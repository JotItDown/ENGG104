1 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.310
The, uh, alternate week next week, it won't be there. It will be thereafter.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.359
Thanks, Eva.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:21.300
Do you upload the recording? Was it? Yeah, I agree.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
So, that's continue in our.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.710
So, I don't know if you want your.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.170
Your mouse, if you want to see how did you do it?

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.760
When was your mistake? Uh, you can email me and I will.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.790
Email the scan. Okay.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.900
So, for example, yeah, ask him.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.580
Uh, we have scans, uh, uh, all, um.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.970
This 1.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.690
This means you, you know.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
Uh, where when you you need some mistake.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
Where you did that okay if you want this email me.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.970
Please email me and.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.840
I will email back to you.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
So, coming back to our.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
Hello.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.470
Coming back to our.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.770
Um, so we have finished, uh, here.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.320
And here we can, uh, we can see that, uh, another source example.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.110
And here, if you want to convert, we will.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.750
But this to become this.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.630
To become this, this means remember the source.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.580
Seem like a source, uh, they have.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.210
This is a + and .

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.390
So, if if we have the current source.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.750
Um, when do you have to convert.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:35.550
We will gaps the priority that is positive, but when the current source, the arrow is downwards.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.400
We will get when we convert, we will get the other the negative.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.660
The opposite 180, so that's why.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.570
In here, it's more but downwards and this is 3 owns.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.870
So, when we want to convert this, uh, this is for multiply by 3.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.590
Because the whole slot, the voltage is 4 multiplied by 3. you get 12, but you need to.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.790
Also brought the opposite priority because.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.700
This is downwards and the resistor in the blue box.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.900
On the left is always the same as the resistor in the blue box on the right.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.200
So this is to answer your transcript here because here we have this setup.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.620
Uh, current sauce and, uh, what is our? So, maybe we can solve it, but it's.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.910
Maybe not straight forward, but if we cover.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.170
But this current source to be clear what the source now, you can.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.790
Is that you can solve this quite easily because this.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.430
To in series, you can remember in the 1st, 2 weeks we learned that.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.380
When they are 2 voltage in series, we can.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.880
Uh, add them depending on the priority of course. So then.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:11.520
We must be careful with the priority, but we can group them together to become, uh, 1 voltage source.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.070
Yeah, so now we we have here i2.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.210
So, if you want to start on the left.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.589
Perhaps we can do, but it's not quite, uh, straightforward. Uh, easy to look at. So, that's why.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:33.599
We, we convert it into a voltage source.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.739
And you can see, now they are in series.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:41.339
In series, so if you.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:47.009
Allows us to find I do so and we can group.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.869
So, we can also group.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.899
And, uh, together yeah.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.489
This looks like this if we bring it.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:05.249
Uh, this 2 here, uh, this.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:15.359
So, on.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:21.149
This 1, I'll bring it here. The plus also will be.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:26.729
This so this can be grouped together.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.979
Um, plus - and also bring it here plus - and, uh.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.729
The 3, the 3 arms.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.079
Actually is in series with the.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:44.519
With these 3 hours, and this is, uh, 2 bones.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:52.109
And now, uh, I do, you know how to do it our own slot and.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:58.769
As the whole, if this is, uh, you can make it as 1.

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:03.569
So, this you can add it as a 1. so if.

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.109
Uh, this is a 5.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:11.549
And this is 12 volts.

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:17.909
So, as a whole it is 17.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:25.679
And please be careful with the priorities. So back, uh, this as a whole is 17.

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:32.669
So, with that, uh, I hope you can, if, you know, this is 17 as a whole, and this is 3 homes and this is.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.539
To I hope you can solve what is the I do right now.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.579
And so we will have a 100 seconds.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:49.949
Do solve what is 5 to.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.029
So, what is, uh, the value of I do.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:16.409
Okay, so I think, uh.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.979
We can proceed it proceed.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.629
Is the release and let me check the progress.

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:29.759
79 students 79.

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:36.089
But, minus me, because my name is so 70 students are currently in this room.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:39.899
So that's a very good number.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:44.099
Attending this lecture 70 students, 70 excellence.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:57.299
And then note here, okay, now, I think almost there.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:04.529
It's 41 students, that's what he wants to do this.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:08.609
And there so I to.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:22.859
Okay, I'll do this 1, so, 17 over 5.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:27.179
2+3 5:17:volts divided by 5.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:30.389
So, you can get the I do.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:38.399
So, current sources in parallel, we can add them.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:44.039
So remember if we have, um.

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:49.739
To do a voltage voltage process.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:53.759
Just now a good example previously, if this.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:59.609
2 of these sources in series, we can add them to make it as a whole.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:02.969
To make it as a whole, we can add them together.

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:07.619
But for current sources, if you have.

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:12.119
Current sauce and.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:19.979
And let's say you're in parallel.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:23.909
2 current sources in parallel you can.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:29.189
Add them back down.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:33.779
This is not possible. Uh, it's not, uh.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:39.449
Possible to have 2 current success in series.

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:45.539
So, we cannot that, and also it's not possible.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.709
You have to both sources.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:52.889
In it's not.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:57.719
Possible okay, so we can.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:00.899
Do in parallel and current success we can.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:08.489
We can have it in so what your process we can have in series and W, the current sources we can have in vulnerable.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:13.469 --> 00:10:22.919
So, if we have 2 current success in parallel, we can add them. Let's say this is 1. this is to.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:26.489
As a result, then you can.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:26.489 --> 00:10:32.969
This is as a result then this become 3. M yes.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:32.969 --> 00:10:36.029
That's the 1 that's the 1 thing.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:40.319
Yes.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:44.669
So so as an example here.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:48.989
Uh, we have 6, uh, 10.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:54.869
So, 6 for the opposite side, so 6-10.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:54.869 --> 00:11:01.229
Is -4 so minus for means you right for but.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:01.229 --> 00:11:10.829
The arrows is downwards, the arrows is done so they are in parallel. We can add them, but be careful with the polarities. The arrows are heading down.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:13.949
And how can we.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:18.779
Make the 3 homes and 6 or 8 total.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:24.059
Yes, yes resist the in parallel to resist the in parallel. We.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:34.529
Uh, special formula to register parallel 3xby 6 divided by 3+6 you get, uh, as a whole is 2 homes.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:42.929
2 homes, so if we have 3, uh, current sources in parallel, so we can add them.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:51.269
So, 7 7+4 is 11 11-3 8.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:56.489
So, as a whole it's a arrow is upwards.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:56.489 --> 00:12:03.689
Arrow is pointing upwards so.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:08.819
In this example, we want to find I M.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:12.119
So, in the 1st instance, it might be.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:15.989
Not straightforward or the bit complicated. So why not.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:20.939
Uh, this, uh, this 1.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:26.279
We convert to current source.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:30.989
So, because this already current sauce, so this.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:34.349
Both the sauce, if we convert to current source.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:34.349 --> 00:12:48.299
So, is that T2 divided by X for and the same resistor is now connected in parallel. So I'm just drawing the orange.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:51.899
The orange thing here it.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:56.639
And so this orange to this orange.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:03.029
And now you can observe that 2 current sources in parallel.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:09.089
That can be added together 4 and 6 become 10.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:13.289
4 and 6, uh, become done.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:16.619
Okay, so 10 M, yes.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:25.079
And and, um.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:29.009
So, this, uh, this, uh, uh, Detroit.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:37.349
This football is the 1 current source with each associate the resistor.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:43.439
And this orange is another.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:47.999
Sauce with its associate the resistor in parallel.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:53.099
So this 2, I wonder i2 in parallel, we can make it.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:59.699
10 at them, and this 8 Ops and 24 hours.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:03.839
We, uh, the special formula for 2 resistance in parallel.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:09.629
Uh, which is, uh, a, uh, multiplied by 24.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:12.689
Divided by the.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:18.029
+24, and you will get.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:22.559
Uh, 6 months, so, these 2 parent sources.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:29.789
Let's make it as 1 current sources as a whole with 10 and we.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:33.809
Uh, 6 phones with 6.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:40.259
So, I will, uh, do a different color. So this is.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:46.049
And it's, um, 1 as a whole as a current source.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:46.049 --> 00:14:49.979
And our our load is still.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:53.399
Maintain and from here.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:56.849
From this current source, the 10.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:56.849 --> 00:15:00.659
From the current source with flow here and you can.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:06.029
Observe that it will be split that.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:10.439
Into this and this, so since.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:14.939
I think, you know, you, you can use current divider room.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:14.939 --> 00:15:19.019
You can use the currently by the rule to know.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.759
To to get I L, to get icon. So I'm.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:29.909
So, we did a lot of current divide the room today. I think you, uh, you know, it very well, right now.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:33.119
So, I L, look at the.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.539
What was it branch and so forth?

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.839
So, with that, let's, uh.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:44.369
Let's find let's select the correct answer for.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:53.639
So, uh, let's select the correct answer for.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:57.449 --> 00:16:12.869
This select, we'll put it on so I am.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:25.289
Okay, and using the current divider room.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:29.309
We can update we checked.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:33.749
79 students of 75 students currently here.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:12.509
Yeah, I think, uh, you most lot of correct answers on the left 17 students left yet to attend. So I will.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:18.899
I think I will show, like, soon.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:18.899 --> 00:17:23.039
15 minutes of this 15 most of this.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:31.439
Okay, they will almost.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:40.199
So, I L. is 6 divided by 6+14xby 10. M. yes.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:45.959
Yeah.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:52.199
Um, so, yeah.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:57.959
Uh, take note, uh, this slide number 27.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:06.659
This is for the future equipment, and also to increase your mouse.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:10.679
Let's see.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:24.059
Hello.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:29.159
Hi, that s.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:42.479
Safe.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:54.359
The 104.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:54.359 --> 00:19:09.179
That just and, uh, so we have, uh, I, uh.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:13.739
That's 3.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:13.739 --> 00:19:18.269
That's, uh, we mentioned current source cannot be corrected in series.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:24.419
So this is because it violates the law.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:27.899
Now, let us turn our attention to analysis.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:40.739
Is a metric that provides the nodal voltages of a network that is the voltage form. The various notes of the network to ground.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:45.149
So, previously we have learned.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:54.059
The jobs, current law so now we are going to let, uh, no, the analysis.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:54.059 --> 00:20:04.199
I will just go to the example it's better. It's better than.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:04.199 --> 00:20:08.759
So, if we have, uh, this.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:12.569
We have these circuits and.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:12.569 --> 00:20:16.409
A label the to notes, um.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:20.519
And 0, boots.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:24.779
Cause this point is the same as this point.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:32.099
Yeah, in the same potential so we call it. We want here. We want to here.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:36.959
And we are here and this is 0 volts.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:40.439
This is 0 volts and this is 0.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.439
00:00:volts.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:49.109
0 notes.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:53.759
So this is.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:59.429
The, um.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:03.599
I want is flowing to here.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:08.789
I do is flowing to here, so I.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:11.969
Is.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:11.969 --> 00:21:18.539
-24 divided by.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:22.139
6 months now.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:26.459
I to.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:30.599
-0/that.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:35.309
Bye well here to be more correct? Uh, we want.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:35.309 --> 00:21:40.949
-34 this is 0, so -0, if you want to.

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:45.569
That is a lot of analysis so I want this.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:53.969
Uh, -24-0, divided by 6 by 2 is.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:58.889
-0 divided by 12th.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:03.299
5 months -1.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:06.329
So it's like, uh, 2 potential.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:06.329 --> 00:22:12.839
Um, has 1 a certain amount of voltage at a higher potential.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:18.899
And here, uh, it's, uh, 24 walls 0.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:27.209
So, we won minus the 0 goals between 2 potential. We want 9. 0.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:36.569
Divide it by 12, but here we have another voltage source so we want.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:36.569 --> 00:22:42.179
-24 votes minus, uh, 0.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:46.889
So, because, uh, all slow states that, uh, current.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:46.889 --> 00:22:52.079
Is, uh, both potential difference divided by resistance?

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:59.549
So, here we are just the current here is the potential difference between.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:59.549 --> 00:23:03.269
This, and this is this potential is.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:10.319
This is 0, so this potential difference is B1-0.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:15.209
0, um.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:15.209 --> 00:23:18.299
Yeah, we 1.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:21.509
From here to here is 24.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:26.489
And here is 0, so the current that flows through here.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:32.099
It's own slot the voltage, so the voltage.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:36.749
Is you want -24? 0.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:43.979
Divided by 6 months. Okay.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:47.129
And after we, then we can.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:51.599
Apply the law and the, not the 1.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:51.599 --> 00:24:00.449
Because if we zoom here, uh, here.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:00.449 --> 00:24:08.459
Here and here and here is.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:08.459 --> 00:24:15.629
Is by 2 and here is 1.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:19.919
Here is the current we do not need to do any.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:25.589
Current currently, uh, 1, so we just write the current value.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:29.399
And remember a 2.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:38.009
Arrows going in and arrows going out. So that's why let's say we say going in 1.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:43.349
- minus i2.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:51.959
It was 2:00:and.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:55.229
So, we can, we can.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:55.229 --> 00:25:00.809
Uh, and this, uh, 1.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:07.259
Already 1. mm. Hmm. So 1 and, uh, 1.

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:10.589
Is this 1 is.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:20.849
Uh, here we have the case, uh, uh.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:26.669
It's going up I do is going out and 1 is going to be.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:29.819
So that's.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:33.149
So, what is.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:42.089
Plus I do, we already did just now, that is.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:42.089 --> 00:25:46.139
1 is.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:46.139 --> 00:25:52.559
V1.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:52.559 --> 00:26:00.449
24 overseas, and we did just now that.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:04.109
I do, is we went over 12.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:17.759
So, from here, you can rearrange use some mathematical techniques or rearranging to to get.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:25.019
1, now you want to obtain that is 20 volts, 20 volts.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:29.519
So this is the technique, this call analysis.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:32.999
This technique is called analysis.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:40.499
Let's do, uh, another.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:44.579
Uh, example, yes, John.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:51.719
Same ground, so 00:00:here we can see.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:55.139
We can call it, uh, not.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:55.139 --> 00:27:00.179
And not be 2 K.

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:06.449
We cannot say that they are the same. We cannot say this is.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:06.449 --> 00:27:12.509
Because there is something in the middle, so they are, they must be on this different.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:18.149
Voltage level, but previously.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:23.429
Uh, we can call this, we can call this.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:23.429 --> 00:27:30.119
Because there is nothing in between them, there's no element in between so the same voltage.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:35.879
But in this case, this must be be 1 and this must be some other.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:35.879 --> 00:27:42.689
Some other potential difference we call it. We too, we call it 2, which is different.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:42.689 --> 00:27:51.239
This is different, so they call it. True. Okay so they are in here there are 2 notes. And of course, from now onwards 0.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:54.929
Is you, it's automatic you do not need to.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:58.109
To -0 anymore like last time.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:01.799
Because it's just, uh, automatic.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:08.729
Uh, that they're not there are no. Okay. So if we.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:12.719
Um, if we for this.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:17.579
And for this, uh, we, we are going to.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:20.849
Sort of, uh, step by step the notice.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:26.939
In the notes and the students, uh, we'll.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:32.549
Will cause some of you ask why is it + and .

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:40.889
The software load analysis, the students, we can write the arrows establish.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:45.449
Uh, at the end, you will get the same answer, but, uh, important thing.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:45.449 --> 00:28:48.689
So, for example, and others to them.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:48.689 --> 00:28:53.009
Uh, like to why not? Uh, the arrows.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:58.859
The errors of the current, I'll do it like this.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:05.729
Yes, you can do that as well at the end of our calculation. You will get the same answer.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:12.089
If this to them, what to do arrows of the current from this node like this, it is valid as well.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:12.089 --> 00:29:15.689
But the tips is the, uh, the main important thing.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:15.689 --> 00:29:22.499
If the look at any current source, if the current source already drawn in this.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:27.419
You for the arrows is like this.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:35.639
So, you cannot, uh, change the arrows to, uh, speed up for me. I, I just want to.

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:35.639 --> 00:29:42.449
I like to draw the arrows like this so you cannot do that because the current source is.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:46.259
Already located and it's like this.

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:51.809
So the arrows, uh, but in this manner is outwards.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:55.469
And arrows for this, uh, load.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:55.469 --> 00:30:05.219
Must be inwards, so you must be consistent if you choose this arrow and the, the current is here, the current will go.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:09.899
It works for this note and.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:15.959
To be, uh, for the best for, for and natural.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:15.959 --> 00:30:20.759
The arrows go out is not in this manner in this manner.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:25.739
So, let's do, uh.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:28.829
Let's do the 1st note.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:32.609
The 1, the, the non.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:32.609 --> 00:30:36.959
Not the 1 has 3 arrows.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:40.559
Has 3 arrows the 1st arrows.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:47.099
Is this 1? The current is this 1 and the problem is.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:50.909
And because this is not.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:56.999
-64, as I mentioned, you do need to -0 is automatic.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:56.999 --> 00:31:02.129
So, 164 divided by 8.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:02.129 --> 00:31:05.729
So this is this bracket.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:13.169
So this 1 is.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:20.639
This point is V2 so.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:23.969
Minus B2 divided by phone.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:27.179
You weren't minus B to divide it by phone.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:27.179 --> 00:31:31.979
Show that the potential difference or the voltage.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:34.979
Is the 1 here minus? V2?

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:45.029
Divided by 4 bones and the, the next 1 is already mentioned in terms of current. So you do not need to do any division so you just write.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:52.889
To you just write to Mbps.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:52.889 --> 00:31:55.889
In terms of the negative or positive.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:55.889 --> 00:31:59.579
Since you have chosen all the.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:02.759
Yeah, all the current is outwards.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:07.409
So, you write negative, negative, negative.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:07.409 --> 00:32:14.369
For all the currents and equal to 0 because of the.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:17.519
Because of the principle.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:21.059
So, let's look at.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:21.059 --> 00:32:25.829
Veto has, uh, 2 arrows 2 current going in.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:31.529
And 1 color going out 1 comment is going on.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:31.529 --> 00:32:36.989
So, since this current is going in.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:45.659
So, you write yeah, minus over for the same 1.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:50.279
And this is already too.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:57.779
To, and here, the current going out is V2 over 10.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:01.799
3:2:over time, so I just draw.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:01.799 --> 00:33:05.819
3:3:elements 3 currents in.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:14.249
Brackets so, in this example.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:14.249 --> 00:33:18.869
Uh, this I'm going in.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:18.869 --> 00:33:24.089
Uh, this, uh, going in and this going out.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:28.649
So, based on your convenience, you can say.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:28.649 --> 00:33:36.839
Going in is positive and going out is negative.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:41.459
But if you say going in this negative.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:50.279
You have to be consistent you have to be consistent so going in, in this case, we are consistent that, uh, going in.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:55.769
Is a positive and going out is negative.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:55.769 --> 00:34:04.379
So, we have to, uh, to, uh, any questions 1 question is for the not 1.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:10.049
And the 1, and the next question is, for the note, we to.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:15.629
So, we have 2 simultaneous equation with v1 and.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:29.339
So, I hope you can use simultaneous question to solve for that is the metrics that's already mathematics.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:34.919
For possible like Roseanne.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:40.409
Uh, yes, so if you decide.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:44.369
That, uh, students say, okay, I don't want to.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:48.779
Yeah, is freedom for students, so I don't want, um.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:48.779 --> 00:34:54.269
Okay, this 1 is IDs so I want the arrows to be like this.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:54.269 --> 00:34:59.189
It's fine, it's mean, if you do arrows like this.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:59.189 --> 00:35:07.859
We do -3 1, but it must be consistent for both. So at the end you will get the same answer.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:11.039
So that the only tips are the only thing that.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:11.039 --> 00:35:18.839
The current source, you cannot change the direction cause it's already written here. You cannot write the opposite the rest. You can.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:24.149
You can write, uh, any, that you can use any direction, but.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:24.149 --> 00:35:34.049
Usually here is grounded here is ground, so usually the arrows is better to logically for easy to make this.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:41.039
This is higher potential going down to ground so usually we write the arrow. Like, this seems like this.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:44.459
Error like this because here is.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:51.089
But the others you can choose, you can choose, uh, your direction.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:51.089 --> 00:35:56.129
You can choose your direction so, in this 1, this is our code.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:56.129 --> 00:36:03.359
This direction is chosen this direction is chosen.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:10.559
Uh, I think in mass 1 for 1, and I believe some of you, uh, have done best 1 for 2 and so forth.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:14.489
This app to these are the 2 simultaneous questions.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:14.489 --> 00:36:19.829
So, it's up to you, whether you want to use a favors rule um.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:30.119
You want to just solve, uh, 2, simultaneous equation substitution method. So, the freedom is for the students to choose in this example.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:34.019
It is, uh, Christmas using the famous methods.

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:38.069
Some metrics methods, so.

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:46.079
Uh, if you remember, uh, memorize how to how to solve to using metrics method, but.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:52.949
You can if you are not comfortable with tremors rule, you can just use substitution.

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:56.609
So this 1-this and so forth.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:56.609 --> 00:37:08.999
And then you can get we want and we same answer. V1 is the 7.2volts and is 32.73volts.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:13.409
So this is room, but if you want to use, you can revise this.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:19.919
Uh, to get, uh, uh, to know what is room.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:24.599
So, in here, there's another example.

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:32.099
Another example here, so obvious so usually, uh, and we do the student.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:32.099 --> 00:37:40.409
We'll identify the notes. Sometimes the question also identify already. You just used to be 1.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:43.499
And because there is an element here.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:43.499 --> 00:37:49.049
We must work here we do, it cannot be 1 because it, it's not in the same potential.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:53.729
So, we want and this is 0, the reference is 0.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:56.909
Okay, so if we use.

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:56.909 --> 00:38:03.269
We want, and these arrows cannot be changed because the arrow from the current source.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:03.269 --> 00:38:10.799
Is already in this direction here this arrow, usually we go downwards because towards the ground, right?

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:17.100
It's very, um, uh, it's okay if you want to do.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:33.600
The question already right? Draw for you use the questions arrow. Okay if the question has drawn for, you use the questions arrow and if the question have drawn like this use in this direction. Mm. Hmm. And here.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:41.010
Here's, uh, it's not mentioned the arrow, but it's better to go to the ground cause high potential and this is 0.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:48.270
Current and here, the current is in this manner so, uh, to must be in this direction.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:52.560
So, if we go to, uh, not.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.730
So, i1, uh.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.820
Sometimes they use sometimes.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.630
I will, um, after going out is positive.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:07.620
So so the problem, so I won.

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.180
So, I want to use this 1 going out.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.970
Uh, i3, we decide that going outwards is positive. So I want.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:23.040
+3 and here is for.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:29.130
So so I won plus i3-for become 0 or.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.880
+3 equals 2:4:8 so that is.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:38.580
The 1st note, and we can extend it. So I want.

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.780
Is this 1 is, uh, voltage 1?

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.440
-0, so what is 1 divided by? 1?

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:54.900
Or we want divided by 2 so I, uh, this 1 is i3 is v1 because.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:00.450
Currently is moving this way so we weren't minus V2 divided by 12.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:05.100
That is that is.

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.080
Hello, how i2 is going downwards so it must be to.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:17.370
Divided by 6 so i2 is B2 divided by 6 for the notes and we do notes.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:23.490
So, 3 is going in, we call our own is going out.

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:29.010
And the 2 empty current is going out. So i2 last.

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:32.550
To is equal to 3.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:37.200
And then we have 2 simultaneous a question with.

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.790
Uh, we want and we do, so we can now so.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:48.630
The, and so the 1 last example, here.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.870
Before we finish and.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:51.870 --> 00:41:04.830
Before we finish, so here another example, we, we call, uh, if there is nothing mentioned, we just write our own and.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:11.400
And here this and this is better, this 1 must be mandatory.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.970
Uh, is going in and this.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:21.090
Usually, if there's, uh, the current is going to be 1 towards the ground.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:24.150
And the 2 is mandatory in this direction.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.800
And here is up to you, but I can see.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:39.330
Yeah, I do believe he has flipped and then go in here. I want so, if this nicer or better that this current is in this direction.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:45.690
That's like this going here, but if you in case, you're right on the opposite.

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:50.190
Be consistent and you will, uh, reach the same answer.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.600
So this is the case, um.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:00.150
2 arrows 1 arrow going in to arrows going up. So.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.350
The i3 is going in.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.700
And the 1 going out is to and I are 1.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:14.430
So, 3 since the arrow is from here, so V2-1 over 3.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.610
2 MVPs going out and.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:21.600
I are 1 is over 6.

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.060
So, at this, not be to, um.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:32.790
1:1:uh current going in and 2 arrows or 2 current going out.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:40.620
So the 1 is going in these 3 the 1 that's going out his i3 and I are 2.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:47.130
So, i3 is we do minus v1 over 3.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:57.000
And I are, too, is we to divide -0 or V2 divided by phone? So we have 2 similar tendency questions.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Uh, we unknowns we want, so we can solve it. We can certainly.

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.330
So think any questions on the best, hope you do better or.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:17.820
Performance as for next week's quiz to pick next week's piece.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:25.830
And well done to your performance in 1 this 1, thank you. See you next.

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:45.830
See, you next week or not I will, uh, it will be the same. Same. Same. Same. W, how many questions? Uh, 1 hour I didn't I didn't put it in. My thing is, uh, only a few questions. Any questions.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.850
It's awesome.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.240
Hello.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.240
So.

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.850
Yes.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.940
This is a possibility.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:21.090
10:45:sorry I keep right from the break. You talked about that last week squeeze on the backside, or? Oh, yes, yeah, because I didn't see it on the.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.800
Can you, can you get a ID number? 8? 1.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:31.080
Hello.

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:37.050
Stage 1:9:3 so.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:44.010
Stop recording this. Are they going to be released themselves? Yes, because, uh, I'm waiting.
