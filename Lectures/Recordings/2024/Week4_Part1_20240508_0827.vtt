00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.799
Testing testing testing 1.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:49.040
Hello.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:23.550
Hello.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.339
Okay, cool.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.989
This 1, so I would rather be the performance.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.369
Accomplish because tomorrow is the.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.719
Students students, we just want to add it.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.839
Yeah.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.289
So, what and what I have done here.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.949
This so I have a scan.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.619
All the answers all your answers. Okay.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.729
And if you want, you email me.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:26.069
And I will, uh, I will email you, uh, the 1 that I'm, uh, the 1 that 1.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.479
So that's overall, um, is very good. So.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:41.189
So this is just I have not published it yet, because I will wait for tomorrow's tomorrow's, uh, students to.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.539
To publish them together so there are, um.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.419
In with the marks here and the 4 months is 20.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.809
So, I see a lot of good marks, uh, 20 months and so forth.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:03.719
16 or 5.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:13.949
Um, so, yeah, some empty because these students will sit for tomorrow's, uh, Chris 1. mm. Hmm.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.249
And so I just brought a little bit.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.429
This 1.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:35.429
This 1.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.779
There are 1 of the total of 100.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.939
Empty empty.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.979
86 students, so the plans, uh, the, the speakers have not.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.059
6, yeah, they will see for tomorrow. So these are the.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:15.059
Um, I will only publish together when everyone has received the exam.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:21.869
And again, um, if you want if you want, uh, these are all the.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:31.709
The scan, so you can see what is what you have done, right? Or what you can improve. Okay. So.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:37.859
That's, uh, I will, um, continue with this.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:41.849
With, uh, where we stopped, uh, last.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:46.709
Last week, last week.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:07:54.179 --> 00:08:01.649
Soon.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:17.999
So, last week, uh, we have started, uh, some 7 slides.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:23.789
Introduce you to the, uh, series and parallel network combination.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:31.079
So, here we and then we also use a, we also learn a current.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:39.389
Current divided theory last week currently write a theory last week.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:45.539
So, in here, so, from now, on, which when you see a problem or a question.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:48.569
In 3rd, and they will be.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:53.069
Many knowledge or black knowledge.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:08:53.069 --> 00:09:00.089
Uh, not just 1 part of knowledge, so you might use, uh, current provider and then you might use.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:06.209
I don't know how to make it as a total resistance. So, in this example.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:13.169
Um, I mean, I thought we do, and I s.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:19.439
In this order, this means, uh, I focus and then try to find.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:25.709
We do next and then try to find I s, next.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:29.789
So, here, we, uh, we can see that, um.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:35.159
Here you can observe that. This is too in parallel.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:46.169
And what do we learn from a parallel parallel uh, resistance? They are parallel means same voltage.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.469
Means same voltage.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:54.719
So, now, uh, if we want to find out for.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.859
Immediately, you know, hey, this.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:02.489
And so I will do it all.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:02.489 --> 00:10:07.769
So, this, this voltage.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:12.089
Is the same as this voltage.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:16.289
And the stamp has this voltage because they are.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:20.609
In parallel, so if we know that this is 12 volts.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:28.019
This branch must be and this branch must also be books.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.799
So, if this is 12 volts.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:36.479
And this is 8.20so immediately.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:40.529
We can use, um.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:45.869
Oh, slow because current is voltage.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:10:45.869 --> 00:11:00.449
Divided by resistance, therefore, I thought these voltage of that, which is 12 volts divided by the resistance in that branch, which is endpoint to Geno.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:00.449 --> 00:11:04.469
So, did therefore, I thought is.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:04.469 --> 00:11:08.519
1543000000.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:15.719
So we have so I'm form, so we want to solve.

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:20.789
We do next, so we do is.

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:23.789
Is, uh, here.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:27.179
And we can know that this 2.

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:30.179
How to add are 3 are in parallel so.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:38.819
2 v2, so that's the 1st step but, um.

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:44.099
Let's let's, uh, summarize.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:48.869
To be blue box is going to be a total.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:53.069
So, the good blue box after the.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:56.339
I hope you still remember.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:11:56.339 --> 00:12:07.349
To the case special case of 2 resistance in parallel, we do not get to use the normal formula. We use only.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:07.349 --> 00:12:14.459
Um, if we have to, uh, resistance in parallel, not 3, not 4, we can use.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:18.719
Formula which states to get the total is, uh.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:22.859
The 1st register in. Hello?

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:26.579
Multiply by the 2nd, resist to 0.

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.419
Divide that by the 1st resist term.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:35.579
Plus the 2nd resistance, so this special formula.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:38.789
And from only 2 registers in parallel.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:46.829
That we can find the out of the so, once we find the after the, it is 1.82nodes.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:50.729
So, we can now this branch.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:50.729 --> 00:12:53.909
The of the orange.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:53.909 --> 00:12:58.979
And the blue, the orange is 6.8kilohertz.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:09.119
And the blue box as a result, and or total, we have just found out it is 1.80.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:14.159
So, when we when we want to find a way through.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:18.089
Because this too is.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:28.049
Yeah, and now it's already summarized as 1.8kilo for these 2 has been summarize.

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:34.619
As 1.8kilo, so all slots states that we do.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:38.429
Is the voltage across this.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:47.699
The same voltage because it's already summarized the same voltage across the 1.80so. We true.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:54.329
Both law states that voltage is B, goes to. So we do.

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:58.499
Is, um, um.

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:13:58.499 --> 00:14:02.249
At 1.8kilo, which is.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:02.249 --> 00:14:07.079
Uh, the blue box, but we do not know. Yeah.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.379
I want so the best.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:15.569
The best is to find the now so the, I want.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:20.789
This now we found now, this 1 is by 1.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.149
So this is still and, you know, that.

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:29.849
There is, uh, the the orange and the blue box are in series.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:29.849 --> 00:14:34.289
So, when they are in series, so I want.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:38.279
The law I work is voltage.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:43.319
Divide that by the resistor in series, so resistant in series.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:50.129
We add them so, 12 volts divided by 6.80.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:58.979
Last 1.8kilo, so then we get 1.4Million so the same current costs in series.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:03.659
Current is the same no splits or anything? No. Split in.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:08.669
So, current is the same so when, uh, we know I.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:11.759
So, we can update the week 2.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:15.209
The V2 across.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:20.309
The blue box, the way to cross the blue box is all.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:20.309 --> 00:15:24.209
The current we just found it's 1.4000.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:30.659
And the blue box, the total resistance is 1 point in.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:36.329
Therefore, the voltage to a way through is.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:36.329 --> 00:15:41.129
1.4Million multiplied by 1.8kilohertz.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:45.179
We got 2.52votes.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:49.409
2.52votes.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:49.409 --> 00:15:54.569
To buy 5:2:books so now I'm.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:15:54.569 --> 00:16:01.229
So, observe that we, we use many, uh, techniques.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:10.469
We use the techniques that says, uh, voltage are the same for federal resist parallel branches.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.859
That we use the technique.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:18.059
To parallel resistors can be summarized as.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:24.539
After the, and then we use the theory or the concept that.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:30.269
Same will be the, the current will be the same when.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:34.169
It flows into the same series circuit.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:39.419
And we use both law and now we obtain.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:47.999
I want after we've updated, I want now we updated we need to.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:59.279
So so there are several techniques, but trying to use the easiest way. So now, if we observe, uh, this, uh, note.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:09.329
Because the last tasks for us is to find so this not just, uh.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:15.059
Right it on the site, this node the is flowing here.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:19.109
And that is branching out 1 is here.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:23.909
And 1 is here so the branching out.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:27.959
Because this is I for which we already.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:31.019
Obtain as.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:35.579
The 1st, 1, I thought is 1.43000.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:42.299
And the branching out the next 1 is here is on 1, which we also.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:49.259
Already updated as 1.4.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:53.069
This 1 is 104 the Mbps.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:53.069 --> 00:17:57.419
And this 1 is 1.43.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:17:57.419 --> 00:18:04.949
So, what, uh, what theory should we do to get a.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:10.409
What is the best story at this moment?

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:14.939
Casey, so, um.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:14.939 --> 00:18:20.519
From the 1st objects, you can see that a current is.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:27.959
Or you can use the, the theories of okay, how in this road.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:27.959 --> 00:18:37.079
How many arrows going in and how many arrows going up? So, let's say the arrows going in in we say it is positive. I guess.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:42.419
The arrows going out, we write it as negative.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:46.559
This 1 is another arrow going out right? S, negative.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:52.859
And we, uh, equal 8:2:00.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:58.529
And we already know I want we already know therefore we can.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.739
Slides, uh, I s.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:08.399
Which is 2.830002.3000.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:11.789
So, hopefully you can.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:17.519
When you attend the center, uh, see the overall feature.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.819
Which 1 is the, the best and.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:26.069
The easiest and the best to solve to solve the problem. So.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:43.529
So, this now, just now, we have done it, so, this is just like, uh, another working same working. We have already done it just now. So I will go to the next 1.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:51.689
So, in this 1, uh, this is the full circle.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:59.009
And they asked us to find the currents, which means we were asked to find I, a.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:02.009
I want I do.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:06.929
I B, and I see.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:06.929 --> 00:20:11.999
And I'll see so.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:11.999 --> 00:20:17.189
Hello, I think the best, uh, can I ask, uh, this blue box.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:21.929
What is because this.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:26.159
Is split it right? Uh, 3 D. we don't know yet.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:34.229
Um, we don't know this current because, uh, I'm just writing it actually the, the orange we don't know. Yet I fall.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:34.229 --> 00:20:38.789
Um, okay, um.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:45.989
So, I think, um, we have not 6.8volts. Okay.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:45.989 --> 00:20:53.639
We know 6.8volts. So then if we know 16.8volts.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:20:53.639 --> 00:21:01.109
Why not we summarize all these, uh, elements into 1 after 2.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:06.479
Then we know what is the from there we can find.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:10.469
I, I because I is the current flowing.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:14.279
From does voltage sauce.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:22.949
You can use the old slot, um, because we know 16.8books. And by this time we also know our total.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:29.249
We also know after them, so.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:29.249 --> 00:21:32.909
How to get our total this means.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:38.729
Let's start with the purple as to just draw it as a purple box.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:48.899
So, here, obviously these 2 are in are in parallel so are in forever and remember.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:52.649
Formula for federal 2.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:52.649 --> 00:21:57.989
Special case for 2 resistance in parallel. We, the formula is that.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:21:57.989 --> 00:22:02.309
The 1st resist the multiplied by the 2nd register.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:07.949
By that by the 1st resistance, plus the 2nd is is done.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:07.949 --> 00:22:11.609
So, in this case, 6 are multiply by 3.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:16.349
Divided by 6+3 so the purpose.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:16.349 --> 00:22:20.399
As the total I call it.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:23.669
Total that if it was 2 to.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:29.549
It was the 2 hours, so this couple of 2 OEMs.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:33.569
Here this branch, you can obviously see that.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:38.699
This is forms and this purpose is 2 OEMs. There are in series.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:47.009
So, in series, man means we can act the 2 resistance. So, for plus the purple.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:47.009 --> 00:22:53.129
2 hours we will get 6 homes. We will get.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:53.129 --> 00:22:57.479
6 hours and we observed that.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:02.729
Does this so this branch is 6 or as a whole.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:08.459
And this 6 hours as a whole, we can observe is in parallel.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:08.459 --> 00:23:14.399
With the the 3 OEMs.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:18.839
In in, in parallel with 3.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:23.099
So, and also we can use the.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:28.139
Uh, 2, this means if I draw it.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:32.249
6 and 3 here, 603 we can use the same.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:38.639
Uh, the same, um, special formula 6 multiplied by 3.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:42.059
Divide that by 6 0.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:46.439
+3 so overall, it will become.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:51.719
This too, as an overall will become 2, 2.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:51.719 --> 00:23:58.799
Now, look at this too. This is 906.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:04.889
There are 2 resisters in parallel, so we can use.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:09.989
Uh, 9 the same formula to make it a total.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:09.989 --> 00:24:15.089
So 9 multiplied by 6 divided by 9+6.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:15.089 --> 00:24:19.529
And you got some value, so no.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:24.059
Now, so this 1.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:27.059
This 1, we already obtained as a whole.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:31.679
Just now that's the whole.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:34.889
And now this 2.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:34.889 --> 00:24:38.819
Uh, this 2 in parallel, we can summarize.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:43.079
Uh, that's the whole and this value.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:48.809
So, we at the end, I will throw it here.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:48.809 --> 00:24:53.369
So, this as a whole is 1.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:58.229
And this as the whole is 1.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:24:58.229 --> 00:25:02.759
So these 2 are in series, so as the whole.

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:07.229
You can add them in series.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:12.479
And when do you do that?

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:19.649
Um, so are the steps of this? Uh, I'm not sure, but this is.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:23.759
5, 5.600hours.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:27.299
You can do it at home to prove it.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:30.569
5.6or, as the whole.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:30.569 --> 00:25:34.439
As a whole, and so as a whole.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:38.069
And the, the current from the source is.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:48.629
Obviously, we know 16.8volts and we know our total 5.64you can use both slow to get.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:48.629 --> 00:25:54.239
I so I is 16.8divided by 5.6.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:58.229
3 Mbps so now we.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:25:58.229 --> 00:26:01.799
Of 10, uh, 3, 3.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:08.669
And we obtain 3.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:13.649
So, once we know the the rest will be.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:16.859
Better for us yeah, because.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:23.909
This 3, some of them we split here. Some of them is split here.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:27.809
And we can use which techniques.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:38.699
To find, uh, I want an, to the current dividers, divide us for a special case.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:38.699 --> 00:26:44.549
This means to find I want, so my, my strategy is defined i1. I look.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:48.299
Especially in case States, look at the opposite.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:52.709
Which is 6, so the part I want look at the opposite.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:56.909
6 divided by 6+9.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:26:56.909 --> 00:27:02.789
Multiplied by the original, the total for 3.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:06.389
Fine, uh, to look at the opposite.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:10.169
Which is divided by that.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:10.169 --> 00:27:13.889
9+6 multiplied by.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:13.889 --> 00:27:19.349
The total current origin, the total origin current, which is 3.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:22.439
So you can you see the update.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:26.939
I want and I too and.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:35.249
Some logics from the conservation or current, so when they are splits now they are combined recombined again.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:39.239
So, when there is no loss of current, so I want.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:43.289
Plus i2 will get back 3.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:47.339
So there are 3 MVPs later then it will.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:55.169
Recombine to get back the 3. so the 3 we flowed through here.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:55.169 --> 00:27:59.639
And you can see it is split again, split to 2.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:27:59.639 --> 00:28:10.319
2 branches I. V, and I see 2 branches. So I joined here. It's better. So these 3 coming from from here.

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:17.669
So, redrawing it this 1, it will split. I and and is.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:20.939
The the re, results and.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:24.089
Resistance for this branch is 6 hours.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:24.089 --> 00:28:30.569
And I see these 3 orders, and again, you can use the special formula for the.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:30.569 --> 00:28:35.519
Current devices for to resistance if you want to find.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:40.409
Look at the opposite resistance, which is 3 Ops.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:40.409 --> 00:28:46.529
Divided by 3+6 multiplied by the original current.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:51.239
And if you want to find look at the opposite.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:54.329
This is the which is $6000.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:54.329 --> 00:28:57.419
Divided by 6+3.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:28:57.419 --> 00:29:02.069
Multiplied by the original content, which is to abacus.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:06.809
So, here, okay, now you have.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:14.219
Uh, everything you have for I, I want tied to and I see.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:18.749
So, but 1st of all strategize.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:18.749 --> 00:29:23.759
Uh, do not, uh, attempt immediately, uh, find the best way, or the.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:23.759 --> 00:29:26.849
The the easiest way to get.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:30.659
Your your values and then, um.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:34.619
Then use all the knowledge from the previous.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:38.789
Previous, uh, 4 weeks, previous 4 weeks.

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:41.999
So this is just the same steps.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:45.149
The same steps that we have, um.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:49.229
Just now we have.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:56.249
Now, we have, uh, gone through just now, so we.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:29:56.249 --> 00:30:00.959
So, I hope, um, now, uh, it's the time to.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:11.429
And you are making notes making no sense of course, using on the current divider theory, the host law parallel resistance.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:22.499
And then, so, so be careful, uh, this is 3 resistance in parallel so you cannot use the special formula.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:30.899
But these 2 resistance in parallel, you can use the special formula to find the total resistance. So just be careful.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:34.529
So we want to find, uh.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:40.799
We want I do, I fall and we 5 5.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:45.809
So, let's let's do a step by step.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:56.009
Let's do step by step.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:08.639
So, I have a, um.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:12.659
So, the best, I mean, the best strategy tips is.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:12.659 --> 00:31:22.049
So, okay, the best thing is, uh, like the previous, uh, previous approach, uh, previous approach, we make, uh, everything.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:26.789
Total, and then we can immediately find.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:33.209
I I sauce or because usually we are given the voltage.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:36.269
So, we are given 24 volts.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:40.949
24 volts so the best is to.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:40.949 --> 00:31:44.969
Summarize this, um, as, uh.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:54.869
As a whole, uh, our total Dash, and then summarize this as, uh, our portal dash Dash, and then add them in series.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:54.869 --> 00:31:58.049
And remember that, um.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:06.629
We, uh, these 3, we cannot use the special formula. We must use the long formula.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:11.699
1, over our total for this case is 1 over 6.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:11.699 --> 00:32:16.799
+1 over 6+1 over 2 re, rearranging it back.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:21.269
So R. D. is 1.2.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:25.319
Oh, we call it architecture, so it's not totally totally. Yeah.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:30.029
And what is branch on the right?

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:35.279
For this branch on the right this, we can use their special formula.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:40.979
To get like a total total for this branch.

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:46.199
So, it multiplied by 12 divided by it last 12.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:50.099
I have written here is 4.8.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:54.809
So this 1 as a whole is 1.2.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:32:54.809 --> 00:33:00.029
Whoops, and this 1 as a whole is 4.14.8.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:03.419
And this 1 is 24 votes.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:07.529
Therefore, because.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:12.329
This is the same that flows from the both the sauce.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:12.329 --> 00:33:18.059
Which, which during the we use the.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:24.089
So, if we have this, uh, I s, top to 5.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:32.339
Oh, so so is what takes over resistance, voltage over resistance.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:40.109
So, please enter your answer in.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:40.109 --> 00:33:43.739
Uh, in the in the.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:43.739 --> 00:33:55.079
So you can see in this lecture folder, uh, 2024+uh, 2 for Wednesday.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:33:55.079 --> 00:34:05.549
So, for the 1st time 1st question, I will give, uh, more time I will give 200 seconds. Plus maybe the 1st time you take time to.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:10.679
Enter the system, so this Wednesday.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:15.239
This is this session is called Wednesday.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:19.229
It it may.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:30.119
24, so now, I think you might be able to see in your device.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:33.689
But it's okay the 1st, 1, the 1st question, I give.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:33.689 --> 00:34:40.529
A long time so that so when when I start with you will have, uh, 200 seconds.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:40.529 --> 00:34:44.219
And you will be able to see the question.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:51.209
So, the, this 1st year to find.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:51.209 --> 00:34:58.109
I s, fine I guess.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:01.679
So, what we have learned so far.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:47.009
Very good. Uh, we just want to know how many students 61 students today.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:47.009 --> 00:35:51.929
The 3rd thing is 61, 63 students.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:51.929 --> 00:35:55.769
But still have time, so because the 1st.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:35:55.769 --> 00:36:00.299
Cluster, uh, the time to load.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:00.299 --> 00:36:05.729
To take time to look into the system, so I'll give the 1st question a bit longer.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:12.839
Longer remember this.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:15.989
1.24.8 in series.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:15.989 --> 00:36:21.779
So, you can use your knowledge, uh, when they are in how you can.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:26.159
So this should be what should be adding right? So we added.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:29.849
A total resistance don't have the resistance.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:43.979
The total of resistance resistance.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:43.979 --> 00:36:50.249
So, once you, after you find, I s, it's quite easy because.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:54.749
You can use 3rd divider divider.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:36:54.749 --> 00:37:00.329
So, let me find the later. So, let me see, just for a while the progress.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:00.329 --> 00:37:03.839
So, for election, 71 students.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:10.019
And, um, the so well done.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:13.199
That's the try it again.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:16.679
Next 1st year, and then actually the timer.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:20.339
50 seconds 15 seconds 1.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:20.339 --> 00:37:27.839
It most students left to to answer you have 50 seconds.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:31.559
50 seconds, so then, um.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:41.519
Just wait for a while for most of those 3 months to those.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:46.529
And, um, 3 students.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:46.529 --> 00:37:51.659
Uh, to.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:55.799
71 students attend this lecture today, so we're done.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:37:55.799 --> 00:38:04.589
So, for very, um, right this and good numbers. So I think, uh, so almost there.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:14.460
So, okay, um.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:26.520
So, are you use, which is, uh, 24 volts divided by 1.2+4.86 so you will get.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.550
I s, is.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:38.880
But, actually, you know, it here you already know I, I wrote it here. I forgot to cross this. I forgot to close this.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:46.170
But it's okay, and now you, you can see.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:51.000
When, you know, uh, 4, here, what is this?

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.020
Kevin display the current split, but you have to be careful. You cannot use the special formula.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:03.510
Or the 2 case 2 resist the in parallel because.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:10.170
There are, uh, 3, uh, resistance, um.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:18.450
There are 3 resistors. So you need to use the long normal formula where, if you are to find.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.950
Uh, I and let's say you want to find I to.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:30.000
You must you must, um, total, so our total of this.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Which is here you already know our team.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.780
Divide that by that out too.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:41.220
Multiply by the eye total, which is for.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.820
So, I think a lot of answers already given.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.600
I I think let's do it.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.380
So, population mm. Hmm.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.910
And we have 100 seconds to find.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.500
I too. I too.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:09.660
So, in 100 seconds to find a steps to get to.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:21.180
Hello.

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:26.850
Is this 1.

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:46.850
Just a minute Doug.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:57.870
Okay, I do.

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:02.670
Yeah, let me see the progress. Most students.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.910
75 students, uh.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.570
I will, I think the timer on the space.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:17.130
Let me check how many more? 25 seconds more.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.120
I have to.

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:45.270
Okay, so I think, uh, I will show the answer here so the using a lot, the general or not formula is.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:50.070
0.8yes.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:57.180
So, when the 3 channels, which was split up now, read to be recombined.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.450
And the end, you will get back.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.370
For so that's logical for split.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:15.780
Then they, they are going to recombine to get back for MTS this for will go here. And we'll split.

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:21.450
We'll split and.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:24.720
And so now if you want to.

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:32.130
Get to use eye to eye for. You can use a special formula.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:39.390
So, our for is to get a look at the opposite branch and a 12 divided by.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:45.420
The total 12+8 multiplied by form so you get 2.4.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:51.870
So.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.760
The unknowns is, um.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.760
The next question for you is v1, 1, 2.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.780
What is the best? Yeah been a few techniques.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.210
What do you think are the best, uh, the easiest way to get? We want to.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.270
Okay.

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:29.670
Okay, let's try, uh, WH, how to get the 1. okay the 1st thing is I give you a very good old.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:35.340
The voltage there they are in parallel, so in parallel the voltage.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:40.290
It's the same so the work page here is.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:43.530
The voltage here also equal to be 1.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:48.540
The whole page here is also referred to the v1. So that's the tips that I gave.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:54.300
And then your friend said it's useful snow, so use the fact that.

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:43:54.300 --> 00:44:00.540
The voltage we want we want, and now please use pumps though.

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.840
To obtain B1. Mm hmm.

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:12.570
Please use those law to obtain. Uh, so.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:18.180
So all good results and.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.510
Please use the to obtain.

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:41.510
B1.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.940
You're seeing the fact.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:52.410
We want we are the same for the federal and then use both slow.

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:10.230
So, I'll give you tips cause now you already know you don't know the current here. You don't know that correctly. You know, the current, right?

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.160
So, the voltage across are through.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.860
Is, uh, Karen multiply by resistance?

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:25.560
Uh, 1 is here is equal to is equal to be 1 because.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.770
Yeah, in parallel when do you see the parallel.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.790
Where parallels resistance we want this is.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:41.880
We want this is because they are in parallel in parallel the voltage I've seen.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:48.210
Okay, I see in series, the current.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:45:48.210 --> 00:46:06.090
Just so, let me check.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:11.010
Please finish so this 1.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.430
So, uh, so you observe.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:20.100
Although it's mentioned v1, but it's 1 is here we want also here.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.120
We want to is.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:30.060
Current that we just obtain just now 0.8.

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.150
Multiplied by 6 months.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:40.680
So that is 4.8volts 4.8volts.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:45.510
And last, but not least, uh, uh.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.670
As a whole, um, uh, this 1 is.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:56.190
I thought just now, we have already to use the special formula to, to get.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.060
And, uh, let's go to.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.130
5, so.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:11.460
So, uh, what is the best way to find.

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.690
Similar project, uh, so.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:20.790
If the, uh, so this is for.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:27.540
Oh, is your split? Because which we are asked to find 2.4.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:36.450
This 1 is how many Mbps if this 4 is split into 2.4this 1 is how many Mbps.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:46.530
1.6is 1.6so 5.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.680
Is this okay?

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:55.890
Uh, also, but another approach either student wants to use differently so I will throw it here.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:00.150
So, this to resist this in parallel.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.540
So this is still, uh, poor, sir.

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:10.500
4 Mbps, so these 2 resistors in parallel. Okay. Let's say this to this. I don't want to use this.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.620
Maybe I want to make them.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.370
As a total this 2:8:total.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.690
As a result is what it times 12.

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:27.600
Divided by 8 last 12. how much is that? You saw capitalism.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.980
Uh, 8+10xby divided by +1. Hmm.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:44.190
4.8yes 4.8bones.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:50.790
So so D, they the student might want to say I want to.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:54.750
Uh, to use the.

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:48:54.750 --> 00:49:00.660
What is, uh, is current for multiply by.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.890
By the top, the resistance because.

458 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:11.310
Here here is the.

459 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:19.590
Test in parallel to make it s.

460 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:26.490
This 1 and here is, uh.

461 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:32.400
This 1 is also be 5 because I have been better.

462 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:39.510
Okay.

463 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:43.170
So, that's, uh, you can use, uh.

464 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:48.540
But, I mean, it's the 1st thing is, uh, easy. The 2nd, 1 is.

465 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:55.470
Faster so you, you know that you can use this immediately. So let's do the next question.

466 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:49:55.470 --> 00:50:00.390
What is what is.

467 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:18.330
Remember, uh, is this 1 this mean? This is also be 5, right?

468 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:22.920
So, you can use the car slow for this 1 as well.

469 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.360
So no issue so which 1, which whichever you want to.

470 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.020
But if as I mentioned here, if this is.

471 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:35.730
If this is 5, this must be be 5 so you can use.

472 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.940
This directly also for this branch directly.

473 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:50.130
Yeah, I think almost all.

474 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.540
Got it right? So I will.

475 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:00.390
Uh, proceed with the with the next.

476 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:07.140
So that is, uh, 2.4xby, 8 volts.

477 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:13.050
19.2volts okay.

478 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:22.890
So, for this, uh, this is a challenge question.

479 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:28.980
But I will not go through because can go it at home. I already put a answer here.

480 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:36.060
Because we want to finish by today so that you can study for them. Exactly.

481 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:41.550
Um, week 5.

482 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:48.660
Week 5 yes, we found this week. 5.

483 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.590
Yes, yes, 3 speak for it.

484 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.730
Okay, sweet. Okay. So are.

485 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:02.610
Uh, I will, um, so you have 1 week.

486 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:08.670
Yes, so I will, uh, make it.

487 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:13.650
Good for you. So.

488 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.000
So, and here is current source.

489 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:24.060
So this is voltage source.

490 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:34.620
This is a resistor about this stuff. If this is 10 volts.

491 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.900
No matter the resistor let's say there is there is 1 funeral homes.

492 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.460
Uh, the resistance is 2. kilowatts. Okay.

493 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:53.160
The voltage source will not change, it will be fixed at 10 goals. So we have a new situation.

494 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.290
A new symbol, which is call current source.

495 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.360
Carbon sauce and.

496 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:11.490
A load or a resistance a current source let's say a 1.

497 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:19.320
This is the symbol of current source so whatever happened to the note whether it's 1 kilo or, uh, 2 kilo or 3 kilo.

498 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:25.200
The current will be maintained, so in the electronics or electrical engineering.

499 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.720
As, for example, the battery, your battery is.

500 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:42.210
What data source, because the load changes, it's still maintain your battery maintain stable. So directly is considered as a voltage source.

501 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:47.610
Uh, uh, another application, like, dial.

502 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:53.610
Uh, transition, uh, they are current sauce.

503 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:57.990
Because it produces current, it doesn't matter.

504 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:02.430
What is the load or what is the resistor.

505 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.450
It's still produced the fixed, so that is.

506 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:10.560
A new symbol this is called a current sauce.

507 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:23.940
2.

508 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:32.040
So, in general, current source determines the direction and of the current in the branch where it is the filter.

509 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.930
So, here here is the symbol of the current source.

510 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:42.240
So, and if the battery or the voltage sauce.

511 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.940
We write here last time, maybe 10 goals or 5 roles.

512 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:57.810
Firewalls and so forth the current source we write next week, uh, in terms of how many MP, uh, how many many.

513 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:02.640
How many? Many Mbps so that is, uh, current.

514 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:14.430
So, in this example, the current source is that very.

515 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:18.330
And, uh, resistor is 20, for example.

516 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:21.330
So, he can still use.

517 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:25.860
And this if you observe, uh, this is in series.

518 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:30.300
So, we can use, uh, tag really.

519 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.750
1, what each 1.

520 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:40.200
Is that multiplied by 20.

521 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.700
By by 30 and so that is.

522 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:49.530
Uh, 400 volts, 200 books.

523 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:55:56.310 --> 00:56:02.700
Uh, so so I will go to the announcement.

524 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:07.740
Announcement so, uh, next week, uh, they will be.

525 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.480
With them for you for you, you will.

526 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.230
You will, uh, you are agile on Wednesday.

527 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:23.040
So you will, you will get, um, you will do it for 1 hour.

528 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.760
Uh, 10:30:until, 11, 30.

529 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:34.440
So, because this 1 is which 1 is only for the small 1:30:minutes.

530 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.680
But this is for 1 hour, so we will.

531 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:43.740
Uh, we will, it's like a is halfway so we will cover all the.

532 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:49.110
This materials, this materials so, up to today today is.

533 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:57.210
Lecture for, and this which tutorial you are going to do in class tutorial for.

534 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:02.670
So, uh, but, uh, I will.

535 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:12.660
It's not going to be hard. It's not I will not make it hard. Just, um, average, average from average.

536 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:18.630
And so this is the source condition if we.

537 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:26.190
Depending on how we want to solve a 2nd, if we have a current sauce.

538 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:32.250
Current source we want to convert because perhaps it's true.

539 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:37.140
It's a current source, but in terms of circuits solving, we need to.

540 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.770
And put it into, uh, what it sauce.

541 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.130
So then you can be, uh, soft easily.

542 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:49.380
So, let's look at this 1, so this blue box.

543 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:55.050
Uh, it's, uh, voltage sauce with a.

544 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:01.980
So, perhaps for solving, uh, to be simple to solve you want to.

545 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:08.160
Or would this blue box into a current source with a resistance?

546 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.810
So, voltage sauce in series it serious.

547 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:16.050
And the current source is in parallel.

548 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:21.270
So, for example, 6 books and 2.

549 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:26.940
You use, uh, to convert into current source because the current is.

550 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:36.090
Log the voltage 6 divided by 2. OEMs. So you right here.

551 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:44.730
Next 2 week, 3, you next next to the current source, you write 3.

552 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.380
So this means you have successfully converted this blue box.

553 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:55.020
Into this, another blue box and to convert if the.

554 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:58.470
The resistance is in series with the current source.

555 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:04.350
When you convert, so when the resistance in series with the voltage source.

556 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:08.190
When you convert the resist the same resistance.

557 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:14.100
We will be in parallel with the current source. The resist the value will not change.

558 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.910
When is 2 hours. This is too.

559 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:23.490
Is the layout previously the resistor in series?

560 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:28.290
Now, the resistor in parallel and of course, the current.

561 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:34.110
We use all slot to get the value of the current source.

562 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:41.520
We get the value of the current source vice versa vice versa. So if you have, uh, current sauce.

563 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.630
You want to convert this blue box on the right?

564 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.900
So be careful about the sauce you can do that also.

565 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:52.800
So you can if this is 3.

566 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:59.250
And this is 2 arms. So what all SLAs states that voltage is current.

567 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.340
Multiplied by resistance, so.

568 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:11.850
3 multiplied by 2 is 6 books and a resistor will remain the same. The resistor will be in serious with the voltage source.

569 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:17.910
So this is this is for the source corporation techniques.

570 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:24.510
Provision that needs to me.

571 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:34.170
Sure, um, I was I was I will go to that and I'll come back. Yeah, I will go to that. Now you can see here.

572 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:39.390
Um, for some is more suitable.

573 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:43.470
To be using current source to solve the 2nd.

574 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:48.480
Samsung, a Samsung, or what is.

575 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.480
It would be difficult. So, let me convert to a current source to solve the system to make it easier.

576 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.770
Hello.

577 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:04.290
This from serious to parallel.

578 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.520
So, um, the, the, the rule is.

579 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.660
The current the voltage sauce is series.

580 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:19.950
The current source in parallel, so this means the current source cannot be.

581 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:23.010
The Register cannot be in series.

582 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:29.700
Yes, so that's the rule and also exactly. So this will be like this. So.

583 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:40.380
The voltage source will be in series with a resistor and the current source will be in parallel with the resistance and vice versa. So if you want to call it.

584 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.690
This can go from left to right? Or from right to left.

585 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:58.170
Right so let us, uh, do 1 example here.

586 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:04.110
So, here we, uh, we had, let's focus on the left.

587 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:10.470
I want to so, here, the blue box is the.

588 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:14.070
Uh, the, what the sauce with.

589 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:19.620
With the R. S in series and then is connector.

590 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.060
Connector to the load this is stuff. Phones.

591 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:29.430
Homes.

592 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:35.580
And so.

593 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:41.280
How to get, uh, I load so I think, you know.

594 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.600
Overall is a series, right? Serious. And you can use to get.

595 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.180
I, LL is voltage over total resistance.

596 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.510
So, if you look at here, I am.

597 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:05.190
Is a voltage and these 2:2:OEMs and forms are in series. So I think.

598 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:10.170
You know, the answer, you know, the answer. So I give you.

599 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:15.270
And I will give you the I already explained.

600 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.880
Let me go back to the to do that. Let's.

601 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.330
To replace and, um.

602 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.710
Go back to that place just now, um, continue.

603 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:57.300
Go back to that place.

604 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:09.870
This this is the place just now, go back to the sessions in progress.

605 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:24.360
Okay, so, uh, the, the next question is, what is the I. L or.

606 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:29.010
And I know you can see this is, uh, series.

607 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.000
This is just both slot can we use? So.

608 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:45.030
The next question is that what is the.

609 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:48.180
Uh, for this.

610 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.140
Think, um, and very suitable, so let's.

611 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.070
Continue Thank you doing.

612 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:18.630
So it was 1 Mbps honestly is 1.

613 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:24.570
So now, if you convert this, you do the conversion from this blue box to.

614 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:27.810
The current sauce you can see that.

615 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:34.470
This will be 3 Mbps for the current source and the same register. 2 homes.

616 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:39.210
And here, the white part around our load is still holes.

617 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:43.710
So, can if we look at the right.

618 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:47.940
If this is 3 from here.

619 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.090
I believe you agree with me, it will split, right?

620 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.830
Split so I looked.

621 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:05:55.830 --> 01:06:00.090
You use which techniques.

622 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.420
Kevin currently wider for this.

623 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:10.980
3 split to this, uh, you can use the special formula for 2 resistance in parallel.

624 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:14.610
But to resistance in parallel, so, uh.

625 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:21.000
I looked okay, so I think, you know, you know, the.

626 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.780
Uh, you know, the formula special resistance, a special formula for 2 resistance in parallel.

627 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.810
Get the I know.

628 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.180
Just to get this item, because here is 3.

629 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.330
To flow here and it's lit up.

630 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:47.910
Some will go here we want to find so we know the 2 owns and follows.

631 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:53.010
So we can now 10, uh.

632 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:06:53.010 --> 01:07:00.330
We can download it. I, uh, so, uh.

633 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:03.360
So 3 areas split.

634 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:09.930
So, I am, I am.

635 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:15.720
I, LL is go to, uh, look at the opposite branch and so forth. I just mentioned.

636 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:22.590
Last last few few slides somewhat examples.

637 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:40.500
Let me see the progress. Okay. That's very good. Um.

638 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.070
I have is, uh.

639 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:54.120
So, I, I'll use the current divider theory. Divider. Do you need.

640 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:14.130
I'll use the current divider theory, finish 3 seconds. So I am.

641 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:18.630
It's, uh, 2 divided by, um.

642 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:26.520
So, this mistake here, 2+4 is 6 multiplied by 3? Yes.

643 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.240
So, 2+oh.

644 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.070
2+4xby 3.

645 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:38.910
And last, but not least before we take family breaks.

646 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:43.890
So, if this is, what is the L.

647 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:53.760
What is, uh, V. L. so we already know I am.

648 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.310
And we know are also, I believe you can use your knowledge.

649 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:03.030
To get a V. L. L.

650 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:12.090
You can use your knowledge to get all slots, get.

651 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:35.780
Hello.

652 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.360
Use your knowledge to get.

653 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:48.510
And so we will.

654 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:51.630
Take 5 minute bricks probably bring.

655 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:57.690
And see you after 5 minutes to get.

656 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:01.680
Hello.

657 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:08.340
We replaced that. Okay.

658 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:13.530
Yes, I was very and let's talk tomorrow.

659 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:20.580
It's a possibility today. It's like, well, I have to connect it to a, uh.

660 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.760
What's your name again? So we did.

661 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.120
Is it this.

662 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.140
Uh, see, you have a check, so it'll be fun.

663 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:40.620
So, it was, I didn't get a laptop by. I'm not sure. Uh, anyway, uh.

664 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:44.940
Um, I did not bring this, um.

665 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:50.310
Tomorrow next week you will just finished what time it to be.

666 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:54.930
He came up with it because like, the Metro stop.

667 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:03.180
So, this, this meeting there was like a duration you had to take the 1st pass along with it looks like.

668 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.400
If you come from central point yeah. Yeah.

669 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:20.580
85 does it take to come? Okay. Did you lose the cookies?

670 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.880
They pick a week, basically.

671 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.030
Simple questions yes video.

672 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:30.900
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

673 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:44.520
Um, today, uh, lastly, I make it tomorrow everything else. I was doing it yesterday my basic task halfway and, like, it submitted.

674 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.330
Can even add a step for it.

675 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:52.380
I can get today, right? It is what you want us to.

676 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.390
Are you even me or.

677 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:03.000
How do we do this person? Because.

678 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:15.900
I think it was negative understanding so mine is both the documents.

679 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.110
So, it's it's.

680 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:23.700
Well, I think it.

681 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:27.480
All right, so.

682 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:35.580
$100.00.

683 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:40.140
What's our.

684 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.880
Hello.

685 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.270
Right.

686 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.870
Hello.

687 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.620
9.

688 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:01.080
- minus, I think well, I think.

689 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.380
Hello.

690 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:10.680
Yes, both are 1.

691 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.710
Better use the compromise.

692 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3390777088)
01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:21.180
