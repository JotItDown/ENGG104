Okay.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.549
That was the name.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.699

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:40.589
Well.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:45.929
You don't want to.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:51.359
What was what.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:55.109
Right.

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:59.309
Hello.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:04.079
Exactly.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:08.999
Thanks.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:13.169
Okay, okay. Um.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:20.009
The question.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:24.959
So, I think, uh, we have.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.349
We okay, 5 minutes.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:36.299
We have the rest for 5 minutes so let us, um, uh, can proceed. Um.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:40.949
We only have 1 more 2 more questions left.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:47.069
2 more, uh, in terms of questions, I really.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:55.499
10:10:30:around that we will complete our material for today.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:55.499 --> 00:11:00.419
I believe it's okay because the 2nd week.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:04.349
So, we, we, we finished around 10:30:OK:ay and.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:12.779
So, we next level voltage divider rule.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:25.859
So, in a series, the larger, the resistance, the more of the applied voltage, it will capture.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:31.439
If our 1 is larger that will capture.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:35.909
A lot of more voltage from.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:43.199
Okay, the ratio of the voltage across series resistance.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:47.939
Will be the same as the ratio of their resistance levels.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:53.129
So, for example, if this is.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.149
If this is 10 volts that volts.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.509
And let's say 1 is.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:04.559
5.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:07.829
And is also.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:16.829
5, so it's going to be divided equally because the ratio is the same.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:26.669
So, uh, we want we'll get 5 votes and we do will get 5 books because 5+5 is 10.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:33.239
If the, let's say the ratio is, um.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:41.159
Yeah, right. We we have more examples in the next steps. The next steps.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:50.699 --> 00:13:03.419
Okay, and the best way to understand this rule is considering the total voltage from the E are being shared amongst the resistance, depending on the respective.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:08.489
Values if all the resistance.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:21.509
So, we have done that, so I don't know.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.869
Scroll.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:33.809
Scroll too slow.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:44.819
An example.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:52.349
Uh, if we have, uh, voltage of 2220 votes, and we have 3 resistance.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:56.429
6 hours 3 hours and what else?

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:59.789
So, the higher the resistance, it will get.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:04.229
The high voltage, uh, uh, proportion.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:04.229 --> 00:14:11.009
And this, the lower, the resistance, it will get the lower voltage proportion.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:18.449
So, um, if we want to find the voltage.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:22.799
Of any of the resistance we use this formula.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:26.459
If let's say we want to find a, we, across.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:30.149
Uh, resist we across 3.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:34.949
Is equals to divided by.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:43.619
Our total our total is our 1+2+3xby. E.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:43.619 --> 00:14:47.279
That's why it's called voltage divider.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:52.379
If you want to find we across, so we do.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:59.579
It equals to divided by the total resistance multiply by.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:12.029
Multiply by 20 books. So here we have 10 owns 20 ohms and 5.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:12.029 --> 00:15:15.779
So we know that we can use.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:15.779 --> 00:15:22.739
The voltage divide the room to get the voltage across the tech OEMs.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:26.369
So, I will right here, let's say the voltage.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:29.969
+1 resist the 1.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:29.969 --> 00:15:36.479
You call it 1 is the, this, according to the formula 10 goals.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:39.569
But that is the resist, uh.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:44.579
1, divided by the total resistance in series.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:49.349
And +20+5, uh, 35.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:54.479
Multiply by the.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:57.719
E, which is 70 walls.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:02.849
So this is the work is divider rule or concept.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:08.549
Similarly, we can do the same for.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:14.099
B, we 3, we across across or 2.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:18.269
So, we can see it.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:23.009
Uh, we across, uh, we call it weekly because we 3 is.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:28.589
20, because that resistance is 20 or divided.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:34.199
By the total resistant in Series 35.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:38.129
And multiply by.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:41.429
Uh, E, which is 70 books.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:47.219
So, we can use your calculators to get.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:50.699
The, and and do the same thing.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:58.589
For week, 2, uh, we do, so we 2 is the resistor 2, which is 5 bones.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:02.909
Multiply by the total resistance.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:08.609
And multiplied multiplied by.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:14.249
The the voltage supply, which is 70 votes.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:14.249 --> 00:17:19.319
So this is what, this divider concept or rules.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:26.489
So, if, uh, we have done just, uh, some steps just now so we won.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:26.489 --> 00:17:35.909
It's been we across resist the 1 is that almost multiplier? Divided by total resistance? 35xby 17.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:41.579
So, I would like to know what is we to.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:46.979
We have done in the previous slides, so we 2 is.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:50.969
What you see, the work is divide the rule.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:59.309
You can now we can now go to the next question to find.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:08.519
Uh, v2, or we across up to.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:12.959
What would it be? What would it be.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:22.889
Sometimes the access is in the form of steps, not the final answer.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:22.889 --> 00:18:28.709
Because we want to check also the, the steps that you understand, not so much.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:34.259
The correct answer, but the steps must be understood by the students.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:40.289
So we have, um, 65, so that's so there's a record.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:48.959
Very good attendance, 65 students attending and we still have a small 1.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:56.639
44 students still still waiting to click the right. Click the access.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:05.699 --> 00:19:12.029
So, for this, so V2 we across.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:16.919
We across, uh, this resistant we of course, this is.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:44.369
Okay.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:48.119
The address the resistance to.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:54.629
I think, yeah, the timeline is finished is completed so.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:54.629 --> 00:20:02.819
5 over 5 OEMs over 25 bones, multiply by 70 books. Okay.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:09.329
So that is, can we across resistant to using the potential.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:09.329 --> 00:20:13.409
What this device this divider.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:13.409 --> 00:20:20.489
So, if we have, uh, 2, you can interchange elements, put them closer together.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:25.589
Because they are in cities, for example, if we have 50 votes.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:25.589 --> 00:20:30.029
Forbes 0.57.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:33.149
And for us, you can.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:36.179
Because series, uh, voltages.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:40.679
It's as if we can use, like, a edition of them.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:48.299
So here is last -50 and do not forget the signs. So if we.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:53.909
Put them closer together. Do not forget the sign is negative. .

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:57.389
Order so when we put that together.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:01.109
The sign is negative last for the 12.5.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:01.109 --> 00:21:08.639
So so, and when the sign is in this menu.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:08.639 --> 00:21:16.979
So, because it's negative plus, so when we, we want to add the 2 voltage sources so we must.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:16.979 --> 00:21:20.489
As a total.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:25.229
-12.5, but this + +50.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:25.229 --> 00:21:33.329
And so that's why the total the total voltage or the result and voltage is.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:36.569
Plus point -12.5 last 50.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:36.569 --> 00:21:44.429
It is the 87 divided 1 multi source. The 7.5volts.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.489
7.5votes.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:54.989
This is, um, because to what the sources in series can be added together.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:54.989 --> 00:22:03.959
So the ground looks like this, the 0 volts. Uh, this is the same boat for the ground.

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:12.119
So, electrical electronic systems are grabbed it for reference and also for safety purposes.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:16.889
Cool. So this is the simple for the ground potential.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:16.889 --> 00:22:23.669
The blue, the blue color, uh, symbol is the ground.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:27.359
So this is.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:33.389
The ground to show that this is, this point is connected to the ground.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:33.389 --> 00:22:39.899
So this point is connected to the ground. Sometimes you can you see a symbol to.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:44.099
In this manner 2 grams.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:51.149
So this is correct also, but this is also if we will do this.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:55.109
It's just a equivalent.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:55.109 --> 00:23:00.089
This to a ground, so, you know, this can be connected.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:12.059
Um, yeah, sometimes the line is not drawn, but they are on this. These 2 are ground so they are connected to the ground.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:16.379 --> 00:23:21.839
Same thing different ways to sketch, but the same meeting. Same meeting.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:30.389
So sometimes the book or the exam question just write.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:34.049
Are 1 or 2 last stuff.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:34.049 --> 00:23:38.579
Without any seems that not complete.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:46.499
But actually it's equivalent, so our 1 or 2 so you just if it's tough votes so you just so.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:52.379
The voltage sauce plus or -12 volts to the.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:52.379 --> 00:23:57.299
Just a way of drawing, but they have the same meaning. Okay.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:03.299
If you see a question, uh, in the book, or in lecture material or 2 today, material.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:07.409
So it means you just put it.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:12.269
12, and that works and do the.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:15.509
Similarly, if this is the case.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:23.999
It's a good is drawn in such a manner that you see and here it seems like it's not completed, but it's.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:27.839
-5, so you just.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:31.439
From here you just add -5 votes.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:31.439 --> 00:24:34.979
So be careful with a sign it shows.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:34.979 --> 00:24:40.169
-5 this meets you must draw the battery terminal.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:45.089
- and + and right here 5 votes.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:48.179
Uh, this is the ground this is the.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:54.179
So, it's not, uh, it's, it's very it's a good but the drawing.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:58.799
Uh, you need to need to understand the drawing.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:58.799 --> 00:25:06.329
And so if -5 just, uh, complete, the secret is such a way.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:16.199
So so if this is, uh.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:22.319
Point a, and point B, sometimes in the book, or in the exact question or tutorial materials.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:27.329
Uh, we like to write a V a. B to indicate.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:31.529
The voltage from across a B.

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:40.439
Sometimes in the book, it's just like or B2. B. R. but sometimes we also write we.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:40.439 --> 00:25:43.859
subscript AV indicate.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:47.699
The voltage between.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:47.699 --> 00:25:59.159
Across point a, and here, this point is positive is negative, so we.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:04.979
But if we write negative value.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:04.979 --> 00:26:11.624
Unless we right yeah.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:18.959
So, it will be, uh, whatever it is, the positive positive value.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:29.759
The positivity, but since it's negative. So if we are we whatever the answer is negative negative.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:39.419
So, let's say this, that box across here, and this is David, and we write the .

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:39.419 --> 00:26:43.649
Dan boots, but if we write.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:51.029
From here, uh, is, uh, 10 books past 10 books.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:55.319
So, we start with the the 1st letter for the.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:55.319 --> 00:27:04.319
So, in other words, uh, we are minutes.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:09.869
The voltage at point a minus the voltage point. B. so this is.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:09.869 --> 00:27:12.989
Also, the logical.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:16.739
The logical way to see it.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:21.209
Simple way to say we is .

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:21.209 --> 00:27:25.109
So, we is.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:25.109 --> 00:27:29.069
Because voltage is potential difference.

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:29.069 --> 00:27:38.339
Voltage is potential difference. So if the point at a is +60 votes.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.909
And voltage and location B is.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:46.289
20 volts so we can say.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:49.439
Uh, the.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:54.779
He's 16-20, which is minus for books.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:54.779 --> 00:28:00.899
So, if we we can if we know.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:05.009
We are, we is 5 votes between here and here.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:14.219
And we know is for goals so we also can find because.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:18.239
Be a .

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:23.489
Bp is, uh, V.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:23.489 --> 00:28:29.819
Of so if is the 1.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:38.249
And maybe it's known, so we can find.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:50.459
The value of the so I've got the steps steps.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:57.629
So, if a B is flagged votes, and this may be is 4 books.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:57.629 --> 00:29:00.689
Use the notation that you have learned.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:00.689 --> 00:29:05.369
So, what is the value of the.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:12.389
What is the value of BA, so the next question.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:21.389
You will have 100 seconds so the value of.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:39.419
On this, right? If not on the left on this, uh, right. Uh, growing.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:42.599
Yeah, asking the question on the.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:47.849
Destroying not the leftover the right from it.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:47.849 --> 00:29:51.749
So, if we are given the, a B.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:51.749 --> 00:29:55.619
And also we be, what is a retail.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:59.489
So, you start concept that.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:03.809
When we see, it means.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:03.809 --> 00:30:18.873
Uh, we minus, uh, we at B, so that's the, the concept that you have to understand, and you can solve that problem. You can solve.

301 "Sameer Ahmed Khan" (671148032)
00:30:18.873 --> 00:30:22.409
I love I love the busy.

302 "Sameer Ahmed Khan" (671148032)
00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:28.319
Please enter with that.

303 "Sameer Ahmed Khan" (671148032)
00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:32.129
Okay.

304 "Sameer Ahmed Khan" (671148032)
00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:38.879
What's that?

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.879
Okay.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:59.309
Think, uh, you got the answer, right? Uh.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:59.309 --> 00:31:03.959
100 seconds, I think has finished so let's revealed the.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:07.469
Answer here that.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:07.469 --> 00:31:12.179
The a 2 equals.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:18.779
To 9, it goes to 9 volts.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:28.019
This is another example you are not.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:31.739
If you are just shown, um.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:37.769
Somehow hanging, but actually, it's you must complete.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:41.279
You must completely separate in.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:46.229
Like, in your own understanding so it looks like this.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:52.649
But it means here is it's written here minus, uh, last 35 volts.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:57.119
It's returned at this point. -19 volts.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:57.119 --> 00:32:01.019
So, you, what you have to do is at this point.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:07.739
+95, you have to draw the battery or multi source plus or -25.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:12.359
And then, at this point is minus 19th so you have to draw.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:17.159
The and positive terminal and you have to write. Yeah.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:17.159 --> 00:32:20.609
19 votes and all of them.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:23.639
Connecting to the ground.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:28.739
So, in other words on.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:34.799
This combination of the 35 votes, and the 9 negative 19.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:40.619
Uh, we'll make +55.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:44.219
On the both the ground.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:44.219 --> 00:32:52.529
And below the ground level is -19 because -19 minutes below 0. so.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:56.099
If you want to combine this 2 is, in fact.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:02.219
+55-.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:07.709
When is 19, so in total the total potential difference.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:11.219
Between these 2 point is 54.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:11.219 --> 00:33:14.309
54 votes good.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:14.309 --> 00:33:18.989
If default votes, so you have to.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:18.989 --> 00:33:24.509
Be extra careful about the science about this silence.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:28.469 --> 00:33:35.819
So, at the end, uh, if you want to write it in, in terms of what voltage sauce as a result in.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:39.449
So you right, 54 in this manner.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:39.449 --> 00:33:45.989
Plus terminal and negative terminal, 54 goals and, of course, you know, that, uh.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:45.989 --> 00:33:50.849
This is 25 opps and this is 20. so now.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:50.849 --> 00:33:57.149
It's like Siri circuit with, uh, 54 volts as the voltage source.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:57.149 --> 00:34:06.569
So, we have almost, uh, we have reached towards the end.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:06.569 --> 00:34:11.549
And as I promise 10:30:almost 10.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:15.239
Um, so when we talk about.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:21.149
Battery has, and after that, uh, if you don't mind, I will show the.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:24.179
The results as a form of motivation.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:27.599
And also you already get some.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:33.899
That will contribute for your overall maps. So when you have a.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:38.159
Actually, battery is not ideal so that we.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.969
At some small resistance.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:47.009
Attached to it, so the is.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:50.249
Uh, inside there is an internal resistance. Mm. Hmm.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:50.249 --> 00:34:55.799
Not an ideal, but we cannot have an ideal battery. Mm. Hmm.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:55.799 --> 00:35:08.309
So so a real voltage source, this will not ideal. A real resource has an internal resistance as the battery is used.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:11.519
Uh, it's output voltage.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:11.519 --> 00:35:18.209
Decreases because as the internal resistance increases.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:18.209 --> 00:35:25.019
So, as explained by now, any current drawn from the battery will produce what this drop.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:25.019 --> 00:35:28.199
Across the internal, but resistance.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:33.059
Lowering the awkward voltage across the 3 tunnels.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:38.069
So, today we have learned a lot.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:41.909
The energy and power series secrets.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:50.219
Um, this is just in series, which is what the low voltage divide a rule and will the sauce.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:53.909
So, with that, uh, I will, uh.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:53.909 --> 00:35:58.409
Plus the session and.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:58.409 --> 00:36:03.569
Because that's the last question and now I will be able to see.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:08.759
Uh, the students who came and also the.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:12.509
So, each students that attempted.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:12.509 --> 00:36:17.699
The quiz, so I will select this session to view.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:24.089
And you can see here, uh, very good marks and I know that.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:24.089 --> 00:36:29.459
What is 1 question was gone? So I will adjust it.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:36.869
Accordingly accordingly manually after this and so well, that to.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:41.429
And to all for that effort.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:46.619
So, see, you next week, let's see next week. Okay.

373 "joud" (3964696320)
00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:51.876
Hello.
