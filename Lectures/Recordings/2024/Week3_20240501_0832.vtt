WEBVTT

1 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.669
So, we want them to we have.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.349
Uh, can follow up.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.649
Yes.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.580
Follow up in the morning.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.970
So, actually, I asked you to memorize.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.880
Because, uh, it's short equation is a sharp equation.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:48.450
I will show you.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.670
So.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
Actually, I will give you the publish date for today. Okay.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.470
But I didn't inform you.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.390
Do you see so that I want you to remember this? But this will be.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.470
The formula sheet, then you will get for list with.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
And so let's go to the.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.690
What are we going to learn for today? Is parallel circuits kirchhoff's, current law and.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
So, previously, last week, uh, we learned, uh, series circuits.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.770
So, today we are parallel sentence owners.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.960
2 common convictions.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.760
This means, uh, our 1 and our to.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.790
Share it and be.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.620
So, the, the of the point 8, and the point we.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.040
A woman to both have 1 and how to.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.100
So this is the backlog paramount's the paramount's and that's.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.130
Therefore, if you have the voltage.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.600
The totals voltage here. How 1.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.560
We'll be having the same voltage and or 2, we'll have the same voltage. So 1.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.040
The voltage across 1 is also in.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.690
And the workloads across up to this, also the.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.190
So, in a in series.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
Uh, last week that we learned in series.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.320
So, if we have 2.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.720
2 resistance in series, and let's say the voltage is.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.800
So, in series, uh, the work is across.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.130
1 is.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.730
It's not equal to the work is across our to.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.500
1 or 2, but in series.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.650
Uh, the current is the same.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.850
Uh, in all places.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.200
But in parallel, so the voltage.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.200
Our 1 is equal to the voltage comes down to, but the.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:57.900
In this branch is not equal to the current here. 1st, the current is split it already. So just imagine.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.350
Here is the original.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.940
This junction some will flow here.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.590
And some will split split into here.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.430
So, talk to.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.050
From the traveling from the.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.390
Will be split that some, we call this.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.899
And some will travel here, have to.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:32.279
I think you, you can see the logic that.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:36.179
And the is by 1.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:44.969
I'll do, I suppose I want because the total current is split that is split the.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.169
So that is the main difference between a series.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.599
And, um, that little sentence.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:03.719
Let us see in here so if we have this, we have 3 diagrams.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.349
We have 3 diagrams the, the lab diagram.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.679
Is you have seen from the previous slide that 1.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.389
Is in parallel to how to, in, in this subject.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.599
The what how to because parallel you have to type, but.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.669
The symbol is, uh, this.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.299
Number 9, so this couple line is a short way of writing that.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:42.359
Is parallel with okay.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:46.289
So, in the 2nd circuit in the middle.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.729
We have an interesting solution.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.929
You can see that.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.079
So, this other 1 is in parallel to have to.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:10.319
So our 1 is in parallel to so that's why you can write the symbol.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.389
The double line. Okay.

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.779
And because.

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.439
This 1.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.909
Double thing parallel with is actually.

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:33.749
Adults who are 3 so here are the right 1.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:37.049
Um, in parallel to to.

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:41.729
This box, we just see this with.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.479
3, so you can see.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:53.039
That this 1, uh, is, uh, I want to opt in parallel as the whole.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.519
And and they are the result of this.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:02.999
Is in series with our as a whole.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:08.099
It's a big, uh, big picture.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:15.149
+3, if you want to see in a big picture, we go, you.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:23.939
And and I assume, okay, this 1, uh, uh, image here.

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:31.559
Uh, this in the big picture, this.

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:38.429
I will change change color so this, uh, this 1 is blue.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:43.799
Is branch is blue and this.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:52.589
This branch is orange, you can see that the blue is in parallel with the origin.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:58.529
The blue the blue branch is in parallel with the orange.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:03.689
But in the blue blue parts itself, if you look at, uh, overview.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:08.609
Uh, our 1 is in series.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:12.899
With so what we can see here.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:17.579
1, because in series.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.639
Uh, resistance, um, ads.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.909
Yeah, I put together so I want to.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:28.529
And how to as a big picture, they are in series.

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:31.619
But this blue branch.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:36.899
Is in parallel with this orange, so I right here in parallel.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:44.609
With our 3, so you have to look at the big picture big picture.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:44.609 --> 00:08:49.049
Look at 1st, in series they are either.

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:56.519
and in parallel this is the same goal of the parallel double double line okay 

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:04.739
So, hopefully, you you look at the product picture and you analyze this occurred in a broader picture.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:13.499
So, in terms of drawing in this book, or in this book that we use.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:25.559
Uh, this several times this, uh, is drawing the straight lines and the straight line at the bottom and the 3 resistance in parallel. So.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:29.219
And it is, uh, in parallel.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:34.079
How do we write? It is in parallel to to.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:39.449
And also in parallel to 3.

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:43.109
So, the the way we write it.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:43.109 --> 00:09:49.109
So these are the 3 resistance in parallel the 3 resistance in.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:52.859
And sometimes the book draws just.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:56.339
Echo 1.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:02.369
It's almost the left and the window is almost the same drawing, but here also we can see.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:15.629
This type of problem is also our 1 is in parallel to entry so they are all the same. It's just a matter of, uh, different drawings. Sometimes you get prompts like this.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:20.519
Sometimes you get drawn, like, in the middle, and sometimes it get wrong.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:25.049
On the right but they are all the same, which is a 1.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:25.049 --> 00:10:29.999
In parallel with are 2 in parallel with our 3.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:41.429
So, yeah, they are all the same circuit, just drawn differently and just drawn different.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:45.059
So, if we this is the formula for the.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:53.639
Because, as I mentioned, if you look, uh, an overview or big picture, so if we have.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:10:53.639 --> 00:11:05.639
Just now an example to resistance in parallel resistance in parallel, but as a whole, as a general form or general formula, if we have, uh.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:10.649
And number of resistance in parallel 4:5:6, 7.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:15.149
8:9:and and so forth. So we have.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:24.749
Formula which states that, uh, by looking at, uh, overview of big picture in this blue box.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:28.979
We, we can find the total resistance.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:37.859
Based on 1, over total resistance was to 1 over 1+1 over up 2+1 over 3.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:41.639
That's 1 hour for until 1.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.789
So this is when we looked at.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:49.229
2 or 3:4:resistance in parallel, we want to summarize.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:52.709
As, uh, or a doctor of.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:11:52.709 --> 00:12:00.179
Of that resistors in parallel we use this formula to get the our portal. Okay. So it's.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:18.389
Uh, because it's too many, so you, you want to ask you, okay as a whole or as total, what is the total resistance of these resistors in parallel? So this will be the formula that you are going to use.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:26.219
So, in the quiz 1, I didn't mention that there's a formula sheet, but actually there is a formula sheet.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:38.939
So, uh, this actually is for the midterm so I provide, uh, every formula for the meter, but of course, we did not learn this yet, or at least 1. so please do not.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:44.939
Not use it, but some of them you can use it.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:51.389
You can use it for the for the quiz 1, but I would say.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:59.939
The quiz 1 is mainly the, the earlier earlier formulas up to up to here. Mm. Hmm.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:09.119
Have to happen. So that is the, uh.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:20.639
Uh, both the resistance, so actually, automatically, uh, we actually want the R. D or our total. So here, we can be arrange.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:25.769
Re, arrange to get the from the mathematical arrangement.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:30.029
So, our total, uh, it was 1 over.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:40.199
1:1:other 1, that's what I'm allowed to wear or, uh, the better.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:40.199 --> 00:13:44.999
A federal set up.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:49.949
As an example, as an example.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:53.849
Uh, you can see that on the left.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:13:53.849 --> 00:14:02.399
Image, uh, there are, I believe you agree with me that the 2 resisters are in parallel, right?

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:06.389
The 2 registers are in parallel, so that for.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:10.319
By using this formula.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:17.069
R. D. is equals to 1 over.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:21.719
A 1 over the 1st register is 3.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:29.009
And the 2nd resist a, is 6.1over 6.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:33.839
So, then you can reduce your calculator and, uh, mathematical.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:37.739
Uh, rearrangement and so forth to get what is.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:37.739 --> 00:14:44.939
What is the, a total or in the blue box? In the blue box in? Mm. Hmm.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:54.419
Similarly, on the right hand side, we have 3 resistance in parallel. So about 3 is.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:58.019
1, over 1, we'll walk over to.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:01.739
So this is 2 last 1 of the.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.149
Uh, 200 cause this is 200.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:10.799
And 1:1:OV:ER 1000.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:24.539
1000 votes, and then you can manipulate, or you can use mathematics manipulation and your calculator to gaps.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:29.939
What is the in in box?

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:40.589
Okay, so, um, if you use your calculator, just now on the left hand side.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:47.939
Is 1 over 103+word over 6 is 2 hosts.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:51.269
So, I hope, uh, you can use your calculator now.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:55.889
To find, what is the R3 out of the.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:02.429
In the 2nd, in the 2nd image, or in the 4th.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:08.579
Because he's a good practice also, and also, at least like, uh.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:14.009
Form of my record for attendance, so in.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:14.009 --> 00:16:17.039
In the lecture folders, you can see.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:21.629
Uh, currently, this is lecture.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:32.159
And Wednesday, so you can see, uh, in plus please. So, uh, sorry, this 1 is 2020.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:35.159
This should this last years.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:41.099
So, I will, uh, use, uh, 2020.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:48.419
24, so you see the correct 1, 2024 in +3 on Wednesday.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:51.749
So, I will click this and.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:54.779
I will call this session.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:16:54.779 --> 00:17:00.269
What is today? Today's date is.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:03.539
So 1st of made.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:06.539
When the MP 4.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:11.129
1st of May 2024.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:11.129 --> 00:17:22.259
So, since this request back here, I will give you more time because maybe need time for loading up for the 1st time. So, with this.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:22.259 --> 00:17:29.459
This the 1st, 1 here is started the 1st question. We started.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:33.029
This is the question.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:37.379
You you can use the formula.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:41.369
That you have just let it just now to.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:41.369 --> 00:17:49.979
Will answer that question who is.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:54.119
Yes, 40 Square is not under that. What do that? 1.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:12.389
So, in this case, you see that, uh, backwards or this.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:18.299
Formula or find the other instance or parallel resistance. Okay. Okay.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:23.759 --> 00:18:34.109
So you have to choose the right, uh, you need everything both so, convert this all approvals.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:38.909
Opening that's why if the 1st question, I give a longer period. Mm. Hmm.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:45.329
Longer periods, so currently what? That? Because 45 students.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:49.079
Uh, our present in this room.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:55.229
And only 16 or 15 students left.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:18:55.229 --> 00:19:00.629
So, if I see 1 or 2, I will add a question. It means.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:05.999
Yeah, uh, you have finish writing.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:13.469
Okay.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:13.469 --> 00:19:17.819
Today today's lecture screen.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:23.399 --> 00:19:32.699
It's like a 3 and, um.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:39.599
So, I can see, now students entering their system.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:44.609
If you want students by 10 students.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:44.609 --> 00:19:47.729
In most of them did not there yet.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:53.099
5,000 dollars. Okay.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:59.309
5 was 2 days left to enter piece of the answers.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:04.589
So this is, uh, I think, uh.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:07.769
If we have, uh, 1 less.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:14.489
1st 1 is me and of course, I don't know ask them. Okay, so I will I also increase.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:14.489 --> 00:20:19.649
So most of that is left and I see here.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:27.869
I can see the timer. The timer will end in 24 seconds. So you have.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:27.869 --> 00:20:35.069
You have 24 centers and 2 most students. So if there's 1 student.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:41.489
At the end, because all the debts almost also, then start at the same.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:47.099
So 1 was to them, please, please enter your answer.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:53.519
And with that, I can end the question. Did.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:20:53.519 --> 00:21:05.039
So this is done, so so that is the steps.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:11.729
Uh, and the answers so what done, uh, I see a lot of, uh.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:17.639
Good, uh, many people that, uh, write answers 48, 45.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:27.119
Okay, the right answers the next 5 minutes. Please try in the next question. That's interesting.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.539
So, um, so let's look at.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:34.079
And the next slide stood, that makes sense.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:39.149
So sometimes is straightforward. This means to the drawing is.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:45.359
Simply, uh, like this like this.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:50.489
Uh, like this, it shows 3 resistors in parallel.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:50.489 --> 00:21:57.599
But sometimes the book or the questioner will.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:06.179
Because, uh, the main point is so I will choose different color. The main point of terrorism is.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:11.759
Uh, at this point, and this point is in the same.

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:15.479
Potential, so there is no nothing in between.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:25.079
In between, so we can say, and also this point, and this point this partnership potential and in between. So sometimes.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:29.609
Yeah, just because they just drop it.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:29.609 --> 00:22:35.009
Uh, like this, because.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:35.009 --> 00:22:38.999
To say that it's still the same because this.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:44.849
This point at this point is the same and this point is the same. So.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:50.999
It's a form of drawing, so if you see the drawing or the, like this, it means it still means.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:56.969
Uh, are to an in parallel, but usually.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:22:56.969 --> 00:23:02.789
So don't panic it means time to re, draw it to say. Oh, this.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:13.559
This part at this point, we are in the same level. So actually it can be drawn like this and actually they are in parallel. I don't know.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:16.709
So, I hope, uh, you have 1.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:16.709 --> 00:23:21.659
Um, I think most of, you know, what is the formula for parallel.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:28.409
To get the now, uh, 3, I sold that. Actually they are.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:28.409 --> 00:23:36.509
In parallel, so I hope you can acting, you will get correct for the next question. So if you have.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:41.729
1 owns owns and 5 bones.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:41.729 --> 00:23:47.429
So 1 thing is, um, just 1 more explanation for you.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:47.429 --> 00:23:51.929
So, I just explained this and, uh.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:58.589
I don't think is, uh, we have 3.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:02.069
So, this this is 3 so actually, this.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:09.479
Can be brought here, but they are the same room. Same room.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:13.229
So let's say you want to bring here, but.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:18.959
Just compare it to here so actually they are in parallel. That's.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:25.229
I tell you, you draw it here or you draw it here actually. Yeah, in parallel.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:25.229 --> 00:24:29.939
And SONYA in parallel so, with that.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:39.659
Uh, I will ask you to click, uh, you will have 100 seconds, um, for the next question I believe you will get.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:43.889
4 months everyone will get the full months.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:43.889 --> 00:24:47.009
So, I will add this question and.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:47.009 --> 00:24:50.699
I will keep the next question. Okay.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:24:50.699 --> 00:25:00.269
So, if I click the next question here, you will be asked to find what is the of the.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:07.199
In in this slot, what is the R. D. uh, our total.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:18.779
For this 2nd, to 40 seconds.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:29.579
So so hopefully you still remember that formula for parallel how to get a parallel resistance.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:33.689
In portal, so let me see how many students.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:33.689 --> 00:25:42.599
59 students in this room 31, 30 is still yet to answer 30 to answer. So let's.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:45.779
Let's continue that.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:51.509 --> 00:25:56.699
So that's good. Uh, very good attendance. 56.

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:25:56.699 --> 00:26:00.149
59 students attending.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:05.159
61, but turning this lecture, 61 students.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:12.089
So, we have only 100 seconds.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:17.459
So, let me see the timer, the timer we have.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:24.389
2019 seconds left 19 so there's that.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:35.639
7 more students you have, uh, 15 seconds, 10 seconds left.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:39.179
To answer to answer your question.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:46.229
So, we have 5:5:more students to students.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:52.469
To I think we can, uh, we can show the answer it out and it is.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:26:52.469 --> 00:27:00.029
1, over 1:1:over 1 level 1+1 level 4+1 row 5.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:06.959
So there is the circuit the drawing from the previous slide.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:13.859
And actually, it's the same as the. So they're out in federal.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:21.239
So, in, uh, if we have 3:3:branches in parallel for branches, we can use.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:26.609
The the long formula, so the output, the.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:34.529
Is equal to 1 over 1 over the a 1.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:39.269
Last 1, over 2.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:45.269
+1 over and 3 last 1 and so far.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:52.139
But if you have only 2 resistance in parallel, you can use a sharp.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:27:52.139 --> 00:28:02.999
The shortcut or a short formula, but only for the case special case of 2 resist the scale parallel. And if you want to find the auto.

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:06.359
This equal to our.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:10.829
Multiply by up to over to.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:15.689
So this is the short formula only for 2.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:20.849
Instead of using the long the long formula for all cases.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:24.599
We can use, uh, this formula, but.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:29.759
This can only be used for 2 for the case of to resistance. So, in this case.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:35.009
3:3:multiplied by 6 phones over.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:35.009 --> 00:28:39.029
3 hours last 6 months so total.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:44.249
For this, for this case is equal to 2 hours.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:44.249 --> 00:28:55.139
So this is a shorter formula that you can use for the case, or through resistance in parallel.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:28:55.139 --> 00:29:01.679
Okay, so that is the formula the formula.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:06.869
Another special case is if all the.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:10.889
All the resistance in parallel have the same.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:17.099
Uh, resistor values. So the 1st, special case that we said is now to resist this in parallel.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:23.339
But if we have 3:4:5 people 2, but all the resistance are equal.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:30.149
So the short, short, uh, or easy way to.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:33.659
That to get the out of the is simply.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:39.119
Uh, each 1:12:divided by how many resistance? 12 over 3.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:43.949
So it's like a short time if all the resistance are in parallel.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:43.949 --> 00:29:50.939
In this case, 3, resistors 12 divided by 3. so our total response.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:56.099
But if, uh, parts for resistance in parallel.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:29:56.099 --> 00:30:09.929
12:12:12:12:So 12 divided by 4 is 3. oops. Okay. So that is shortcut. Short shortcut for a special case. If all the resistance are in parallel.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:09.929 --> 00:30:13.019
So, in the lab, uh, you can.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:22.199
If you want to, you have 3 resistance in parallel so you can put your orbit in this manner. 1 of the red leads.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:22.199 --> 00:30:25.799
On here and the other black beats the ground.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:30.239
To the graph, and you can measure the total resistance.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:30.239 --> 00:30:33.449
When the resistance says are in parallel.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:45.299
Okay, so, as I mentioned, um, previously when the 2 resistance are in parallel.

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:59.699
Uh, the voltage are the same, so we want must be equal to B2. This is the case in parallel and I say just now the common you do this for this junction or this note.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:03.059
The comment will be split, um.

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:06.359
I want and we call it.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:11.069
And I do, and let's say this is I saw for.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:15.089
So, due to conservation of current.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:21.839
When this is the node is split up, so it must be equal to.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:32.159
Last time too, so I asked must surely be equal to I want us to keep the tax logic.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:36.599
And so if we want to.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:44.279
If we know, um, I want and it's also own slot. So I want is.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:52.859
Over 1:00:home and here it is i2 in this branch. I to this 2 over.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:31:52.859 --> 00:32:00.149
Right. Uh, I, it was to be, um, to be overlap.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:05.579
So, the main important things here is the voltage.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:10.259
Where they are internal are the same. So if this is the goals.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:16.499
Is also 12 goals are going to is troubles.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:16.499 --> 00:32:21.329
And so the currently split it. So the current is not the same.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:25.889
So, I just go back to to my 1st slide.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:25.889 --> 00:32:29.339
To mention that in series.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:42.239
The voltage the 1, it's not the same. It could be, but it's not the same but in series, the current is the same in all places in offices.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:45.629
This is the same, but in parallel.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:55.799
The current is not the same in the different branch. It will have different color, but the voltage is the same. So, in series.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:59.729
In series the voltage.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:07.469
It's the same, uh, and in parallel.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:12.989 --> 00:33:19.319
And, uh, so sorry, I, in this 1, this 1.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:22.979
Uh, so in in series, the current is the same.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:27.059
And in parallel, the voltage is the same.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:36.359
So, if we come back here and, you know, theory theory.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:43.619
So, that's why the current is not the same in parallel, but the voltage is the same. So the voltage.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:49.919
It's here it's 12 months and we'll get here is books.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:53.819
But the current is splitting, so the current is not the same.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:58.409
So, I hope you can see the difference.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:33:58.409 --> 00:34:03.029
So, let's do the, let's do this exercise.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:06.449
So, here we see, the current is splinter.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:06.449 --> 00:34:14.639
And we, this in parallel, the voltage is the same. So what this 1 must be 12 volts.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.079
And what is 2 must also be the boats.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:22.259
And using all slot, if this.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:25.619
Currently splitter and we call this.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:30.329
So, in this branch law is I want.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:40.319
It's 12 we is divided by the answer is 12000000.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:52.679
So, I would like to ask you, what is I do in this branch using the same homes long using the same old.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.829
So, in the previous questionnaire in 61.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:59.879
61 students were there and.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:34:59.879 --> 00:35:07.049
1, at 10, but, uh, 52 got it correct well, done.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:07.049 --> 00:35:13.049
Um, for and to please try again in the next question. So the next question.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:13.049 --> 00:35:23.009
Will be about that you have 100 seconds and then is what is onto.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:23.009 --> 00:35:29.819
So, what is I to pay for the, what we have learned just now what we have learned is now.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:35.609 --> 00:35:40.289
Okay, so we have, uh, 100 centers.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:40.289 --> 00:35:43.649
The the product, but everyone is the same.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:49.949
The current source is equal to the sound of the individual branch habits.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:54.209
So, I, as if it goes to, plus I do.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:54.209 --> 00:35:59.219
So, let me see the progress to 62 students.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:03.329
33 students you have to answer.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:08.759
And it's very encouraging, I think.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:08.759 --> 00:36:18.149
All have the correct answer so far, but, uh, 1, still there. Um, let me check. How many seconds.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:18.149 --> 00:36:23.279
41 seconds now it's stealing some time.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:29.069
For you to enter your this is.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:35.099
Um, so it's good, I mean, this contributes to your final box.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:39.119
As, you know, I only take a week 2.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:43.019
4 weeks, but today's week 3 are still doing it.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:43.019 --> 00:36:48.689
So, if you have, I see you have, um, network problems in other weeks.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:48.689 --> 00:36:53.039
So, but you score out in week, 2 and so far. So.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:36:53.039 --> 00:37:05.159
I will take some, uh, to proceed the sandbox that is higher and portfolio to the max. So, let's see, uh, games, um.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:14.189
So, I think we finish the timer is finished already at, um.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:17.489
63 students.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:27.359
But 1 get done with them and you got a majority got new products. Okay so this is.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:36.659
Uh, this is the answer for which is for many MVPs formula.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:44.339
So, we get a split of the current there is now a good time to study the jobs current law.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:53.279
The kirchhoff's, current law states that this has a great some of the comments entering and leaving assumption.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:53.279 --> 00:37:56.519
Oh, the network is equal to 0.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:37:56.519 --> 00:38:03.179
So, if we based on our convenience, if we say that.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:07.529
Um, these arrows, right? Let's say there are.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:07.529 --> 00:38:15.510
Uh, 3:3:junctions, 3:3:3 lines in have 3 lines.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.790
So, if we based on the arrows, let's say the arrows.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.060
That goes into a junction.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.870
We call it positive. We call it .

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.610
But the arrows that goes out, we call it negative.

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.140
So, in this case, last 6-2.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.770
-, and it must be equal to 0.

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.370
So, uh, look at the arrows.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:48.750
Um, in.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:54.390
Uh, I'd like to call it as + and the arrows that goes out.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:59.550
I'd like to call it as negative and let them equal to 0.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:07.560
Like that before, 2:00:So, this is the principle of kirchhoff's current law.

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:15.960
As an example here, so as an example of.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:22.560
So, here, the current is flowing from towards the right thing.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.200
And you will see here, this is Jonathan a.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.760
According to a current law list, a, how many.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.650
How many arrows going into the how many arrows going out.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.860
Okay, I was going in 1.

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.990
How many orders going up to so you can see that.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:50.610
You can right here.

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:57.180
5, in is pointed out is like, uh, negative.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.820
And out is negative and let it equal to 0.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.860
And therefore we can find is.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:13.950
1:1:piece from yeah, we can solve that I want is.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:18.900
1, Mbps, so this.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.040
These are in this in series.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.530
So, they are the same current if this is the same current the.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.370
We'll still be 1.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:45.180
If this is 1:1:will always travel here. There's nothing here they are in series. So this is 1. so you called in series the current always.

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:54.000
See, if this is for and this branch is in series, so for will also travel here.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.240
So, the iPhone is for.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:02.250
So, now, look, look, look at this junction di, how many arrows going in.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:07.770
2 and 2 minutes, uh, positive. So, for.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:15.390
Well, it's 1 of them work is another arrows and this arrow is going.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.590
Uh, outreach, uh, negative.

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.280
And let it equal to 0.

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.410
Therefore, you can deduce that I is.

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:35.850
5 M, yes. So look at the consumption. How many arrows going in how many areas going out.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.740
And then you like equal to 0 So you can solve.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:46.110
And another property here is that if this is 1 area, you have to.

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:51.060
The views, or you have to know that is also what? Plus it's this.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:57.300
What is the series, which is not normal split in any way so it's.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.330
1, and here.

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:09.600
So this is why we have discussed just now we are just discussed this now.

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.080
Find, uh, to find the.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.290
The values of the current, so yeah, more examples.

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.860
Because here you can see some arrows.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:28.140
Uh, are going in some arrows uh, some comments are going in.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.930
And then there is a split and so forth. So there are many interesting.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:38.190
But you just follow the principle, look at the assumption.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:48.870
How many arrows going in how many arrows going out and you left it equal to 0. okay. You like it equal to 0.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:55.380
So that is the fact that the principals stick to the principal and you like it equal to 0.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.460
So, as an example, so this.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.750
Is in this junction a.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:13.860
1 error going in so, 2 arrows going in and what error going out. So, Paul is going in.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.480
The is going in and.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.730
Um, this is so actually, we didn't know that it is.

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:27.390
Several is empty. It's empty.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:33.780
This is unknown yet, so what we can do here we tackle junk shouldn't be. 1st.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:41.310
Should be is, uh, is going in.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:48.780
And I floor is going out and i5.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:43:48.780 --> 00:44:01.290
Is also going out we'll ID equal to 0.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.940
And 708.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:12.150
Uh, I want is, uh, going in.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:21.630
I too is also going in, but I agree is are known, but it's going out so .

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:26.880
Is unknown going out, therefore, i3.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.080
These 7.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:37.680
So, from here, 5:3:7-1.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.360
Uh, by 5 equals to 0.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.860
Therefore, 5:5:is.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:54.660
6 M is 6 Mbps so this.

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:03.750
Solution based on kirchhoff's, current law, the jobs current no.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:11.640
This is another for example, can I ask you how we can get? I. S.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:17.250
What's your opinion?

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.780
You might it might look, uh, not obvious.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:27.090
Some other color, so it might look not obvious if you.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:33.330
If you see what that's how many junction is done, but if you re, draw it.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:39.030
Redraw this 1, uh, as 1 junction. So this.

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:47.520
Tom, so these are all on the same potential. So you can say this.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.360
This and this.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.050
1:2:3, but they are in the same.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:59.700
Potential Junction, so oh, you got the case.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:08.310
1 arrow going in 3 arrows going up you can use the job's kinda no. Okay. But maybe perhaps here.

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:15.480
It's because of the drawing, but actually withdraw it for for you to be sure that.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:23.760
But they are in the same, this point is in the same potential, at least part of the same potential. So is.

458 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.630
Actually, the same note, the same direction.

459 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.840
So this so I just.

460 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:42.300
Authorities same junction. So this means I ask is simply, uh, it's going in the other 1 is going out so I.

461 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:48.840
minus eight minus ten minus two equals to zero 

462 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.870
So this means I ask is.

463 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:56.370
20, maybe.

464 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.550
So, we are in very good track for you to.

465 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:04.170
To rest for before your final before your quiz.

466 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:11.070
But since you are in a good track, I might consider going to let cell phone.

467 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:17.130
What's your opinion?

468 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.940
This lecture 3 will not be in the.

469 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:27.450
So, it's but it's okay let's see. Let's see it later. How it goes.

470 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:31.770
And, uh.

471 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.770
So, now we can okay.

472 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:53.910
I will make it larger. So let's see. Uh, this 1 is so, uh, your, your friendships that, of course, it's 20Million because it's right. Split here.

473 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:47:53.910 --> 00:48:00.930
February split into this branch and 2Million split into this branch.

474 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:06.900
So, can I ask you, um.

475 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:25.800
What is the value of T now in voltage?

476 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.670
So what mm, hmm.

477 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:34.170
16 volts sir 16 votes.

478 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.200
Uh, can you, uh.

479 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:44.040
How do you get 60 votes? Yes yes.

480 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.130
We have to look at overall picture.

481 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:52.380
Parallel in parallel the voltage is the same, right?

482 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:58.920
So, therefore, we don't know, EE, we don't know EE, but we want to find a voltage here.

483 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.790
So, we can look at any of the branch.

484 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:07.080
Because if we find a voltage in here.

485 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.860
We, this voltage is the same.

486 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:15.180
As this, because they are in parallel, this voltage is the same.

487 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:21.000
Has all of this was this how to get the voltage here?

488 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.870
You use all slow, right? Voltage.

489 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.170
In this 1 you use both.

490 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:34.470
And you already know, you know, Karen, and you already know the resistance.

491 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:38.160
So, I think you will get the.

492 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.820
Very good. And you can answer the next question.

493 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:46.920
You can answer the next question.

494 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.660
So, the next question is, what is the value of the.

495 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.740
What is the value of the, uh.

496 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:10.650
Based on this, what is the value of E.

497 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:15.300
Um, in what is, is in volts.

498 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:27.120
Thing you will, um, I think you get right answers. Everyone.

499 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.920
63 students, 60 piece to this.

500 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:46.740
E.

501 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:52.740
What is the value of voltage and how many votes tables.

502 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:50:52.740 --> 00:51:01.170
Can you share this now?

503 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:05.430
Okay, so in parallel circuits.

504 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:11.760
Please locate for this for to be solving.

505 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.360
People on this call, but the idea.

506 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.930
So why not we, we can find the voltage.

507 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:23.670
Yeah, that's also the.

508 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:29.100
That's the whole thing is how to find the whole piece here.

509 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:36.360
We are really good to so we know the content in this runs.

510 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.630
Discuss in this much.

511 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:45.090
So, we can find the voltage across 1.

512 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:49.890
In fact, 1st to the.

513 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.130
So, I think, um.

514 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:57.120
You have finished, so that is the answer is.

515 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.110
2 kilowatts multiply by 8 many Mbps.

516 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:04.590
The answer is 16 votes.

517 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.920
The answer is 600 volts.

518 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:16.950
So, just using the same principle can I ask so, let me check 1st, the progress.

519 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:20.430
Very good. And how many seconds.

520 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:31.980
So, we have to finish, um, we have finished, uh, this question.

521 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.880
So this would good answers that good results.

522 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.290
So, can I know you, you know.

523 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.460
And now is 16, so I write here, uh, 16 volts.

524 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:49.650
Now is already known so can I ask you.

525 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:53.820
What is the value of.

526 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:59.700
So principal or peripheral resistance. Okay.

527 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:09.060
So, let's see, let's go to the next question. What is the value of.

528 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:17.310
What is the value? How many owns probably only? Um.

529 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:21.030
I believe that this is so.

530 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:26.040
And now update the value of.

531 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:11.400
So, let me see some progress.

532 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.110
Very good, uh, 2018 more students.

533 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:20.820
To answer it, it must be this.

534 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:30.240
I think, um.

535 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:38.520
Let's see the timer, uh, 10 more seconds. So, um.

536 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:46.890
Almost there 8 more students you have.

537 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:50.460
10 more seconds or less, so you need to answer.

538 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:54:50.460 --> 00:55:00.540
With your answers so we have more students, 66 students. Okay. 66 students. That's a very good number for election. 66 students.

539 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.100
That's very encouraging very good for the attendance.

540 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.340
And that's next 1.

541 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:15.660
Use the same principle. What is the? Well so now and 2 is 16 volts the same.

542 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.590
Votes is applied because they are in parallel divided.

543 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:23.280
But, but this time divided by so.

544 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.280
Divide by what is the current in that branch so now I'm right here 16.

545 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.990
Now, we already know this is 16.

546 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:39.420
The killer goals next please fine.

547 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.400
What is the value of our 3?

548 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:55.050
How many so you will have 100 seconds in the next question.

549 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:59.850
So, what is the value or the top 3 in.

550 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.970
So, now what is the value of our 3?

551 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.640
Okay, let me see, uh, some progress.

552 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.180
66 students in this room.

553 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:44.550
Excellent. Um, 14 students left to answer thing.

554 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:54.750
3, how many OEMs or how many is.

555 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:10.410
We see the timeline another 29 seconds. We still, uh, still some time.

556 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:17.040
At this time, I see almost all got the right.

557 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:23.160
Except for once to please try in the next next next. Okay.

558 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:28.860
So almost all got the right since we have already.

559 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.760
For students lab, so if I see 2, I will stop.

560 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.360
I did not wait for the time. Okay 5 times.

561 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:53.310
Because 1 of them is me, so I'm, I'm not supposed to answer. So now that wants to do the last of them. Please uh.

562 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:57:53.310 --> 00:58:13.310
Your answer now I think it should be over so let's see, then 16 votes same roles divided by 2. so here I can right there are 2 is 8.

563 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:16.650
And.

564 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:20.460
Last, but not least. Do you still remember formula.

565 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:23.970
Order to find a total resistance.

566 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:29.910
Of 3, resistors in parallel yes.

567 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:37.530
So, you want to I will go back for you to see I believe you write the, the notes.

568 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:42.240
I see the, you have with the notes, but I'll just go back.

569 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:46.650
And then we will answer the question.

570 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:51.480
Formula is.

571 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:59.790
Formula is this 1 the formula is this 1 so now let us.

572 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:13.650
Go back to our question. So now we have 2 kilowatts, 16 and 8 kilohertz in parallel. So what will be the total.

573 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:20.850
So, I will add the question.

574 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:29.880
And that's the next question next question.

575 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:34.590
You have 100 seconds to select.

576 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:54.590
The correct answer.

577 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
00:59:54.590 --> 01:00:05.970
Yes, so sometimes I didn't put the I just put the stats because to give you a practice, because in the final exam.

578 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.810
And the steps are more important than the final answer.

579 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.870
So, you can box for the steps.

580 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:22.080
But if you make, uh, because of time pressure, you press the wrong button in the calculator you perform. And so by the steps are right you can.

581 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:29.730
Of 10 or 9 or 10 so the steps are more important than the final ones.

582 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:39.660
So, let me see.

583 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.740
So, we have still 27 students left.

584 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:48.090
Get to answer.

585 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.490
So then you still have, uh, maybe.

586 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:00:56.490 --> 01:01:03.210
A few more seconds so upload the.

587 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:06.780
So, in this 2nd, we have a lot of.

588 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:11.610
Knowledge or theory that we apply, we apply all.

589 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:19.320
We apply, we apply we apply, uh, how to get total resistance.

590 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:24.150
So, all this, uh, in 1 question in 3rd.

591 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:28.620
And we use it all in 3rd. So, let me see.

592 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.680
Uh, 3 more students, so I think.

593 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.540
Actually, 2, most students and the number is increasing 71.

594 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:42.690
71 students now, actually, 7 piece to this, um, .

595 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:48.990
Me so 70 students, 2 more students left to answers. I think.

596 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:54.300
Um, we can proceed and.

597 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:59.220
The of the is.

598 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:04.560
Uh, is this, uh, the, the formula or.

599 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.850
Rv is, um, the voltage.

600 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:14.550
Over 20Million so that's 2 ways to find the okay.

601 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:22.080
Because this here, let me let me draw it here.

602 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:29.430
Because here is 16 roles and this.

603 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:37.500
Uh, this big, uh, these, all 3, uh, is like a, is a big box.

604 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.120
Yeah, so, um.

605 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:48.150
So, if this is the and this is.

606 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:52.350
And this is, uh, I, I saw.

607 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:02:52.350 --> 01:03:02.730
I guess so also can we can use that are the, uh, this it was to, uh, be.

608 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:09.150
I guess because if we have fun.

609 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.870
E.

610 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:19.410
But another way to do it just now, is was to use the formulas to use the performance.

611 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.390
So, we are in the right track.

612 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:35.430
Um, Karen divide the room last week, we learned a voltage divide the road, right? Voltage divide the room.

613 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:39.870
So, today we are going to continue with currently by the rule.

614 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:44.160
If the 2 panel elements of equal value.

615 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:53.580
The comment will divide equally 4 parallel elements with different values. The smaller the resistance.

616 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.680
The grid, uh, share of the input current.

617 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:07.680
Parallel elements or different values, the current split into a ratio equal to the inverse of the resistance balance.

618 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:15.120
So this 1.

619 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.960
So so for example.

620 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:35.610
If it's, we have to resist this in parallel, but they are the same value 1 kilowatt and 1 kilo.

621 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.540
And if we have the total current flowing.

622 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.740
Is to be a, and they will split into.

623 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.950
Of course, there'll be splits, but since the.

624 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:53.310
Um, 1, kilo and 1 catalog, they are the same values so there will be split.

625 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:04:53.310 --> 01:05:02.820
Equal of course, we can do, uh, formula later, but this is 1 way here and 1 here.

626 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:08.610
Plus or the same vendor so it's a shortcut.

627 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:12.570
So, let's, uh, go to the here.

628 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:17.430
So, obviously, uh, this is 1.

629 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:21.720
Is, uh, the total current it's split into 3.

630 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.610
So, I want I do an ID. Okay. I want to I have to an entry.

631 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:32.760
The 1st branch stand ups, the 2nd branch is 100 goals.

632 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.690
And the 3rd branch is 1000 posts.

633 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:41.340
1000 posts, so.

634 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.370
This is 1st of all.

635 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:47.430
Are the, we find the.

636 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:51.840
You already know how to get you already know.

637 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.470
How to get from the question?

638 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:59.820
1, over RT. Is equals to 1 over 10.

639 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:05.460
+1 over 100+1 over 1000. so we arranging this.

640 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:12.390
Is 9.01goals.

641 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:15.600
So, now the other 1 is.

642 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:22.380
How do we get Taiwan? We take the, this is called the current divide the.

643 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:28.500
So, now you is the, the current.

644 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:35.520
So, 9.1is, the total of resistance divided by 10.

645 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.300
So, if we want to find.

646 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.630
We take your total resistance.

647 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:48.450
9.01and, then we divide.

648 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:56.460
The resistance on the branch, and then we multiply. 9 am please. Okay.

649 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.970
So, I can I ask you.

650 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:07.830
What's your name? Uh, so can I ask you? How about I too can you tell me.

651 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:14.910
How to get, um, I, to base on the current divider rule.

652 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.990
Okay, hold the line.

653 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.420
You bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

654 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.050
So this is how we find, uh.

655 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:52.890
Product in the branch.

656 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:57.420
This this is called the current divider room, the current divide, the room.

657 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:01.110
And I assume assuming a lead.

658 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:12.150
Uh, how about, uh, to get 3.

659 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:16.560
So that is 9.01is.

660 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.080
Total resistance of the all the resistance in parallel.

661 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.830
So you can see here if the resistance is so.

662 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:30.090
Then that goes, we will get the.

663 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:34.860
Share of the current, so you can see the 9.

664 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:40.110
Most of them will travel to the 10 posts.

665 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:45.960
8.11Mbps will travel to the.

666 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.810
0.811will travel to the 100 calls resistance.

667 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:59.370
And only 0.0811will travel to the 1000 pound resistance.

668 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:06.390
So, and it is logical, because resistor means resistance means opposition to.

669 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:10.140
Color, so the last resistance.

670 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:15.960
Uh, available, the more current will be able to flow the more resistance.

671 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:23.970
The last quarter we will be able to flow in depth Resistor.

672 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:28.350
Seems like, uh, previously there is a shortcut formula.

673 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:32.460
If there's only 2 branches, uh, to.

674 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.670
Currently split into 2.

675 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:41.370
Previously, we have 3, we can have 4:4:branches 5.

676 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:49.200
But if in a special case, for only 2 branches, the 3rd is split into 2:2:currents only.

677 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.090
So, if we want to find the 1st.

678 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.750
You can use.

679 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:01.860
Previously, this is the whole.

680 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.550
This is the, the long formula for all the cases.

681 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:10.020
What do we have discuss here? Just now with.

682 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.920
Uh, answering it and now.

683 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.050
But it is a special case of only to resistance we can use.

684 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:22.320
Um, the shock part, which is.

685 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:28.350
I is equals to.

686 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:32.820
We go to the I want is flowing through here, but we look.

687 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:37.350
The next branch, the opposite Resistor.

688 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:47.130
Add 2, and then we divided by last up to.

689 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:53.610
And then we multiply the total.

690 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:58.920
Similarly, what I do if you want to add to.

691 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.600
Add to is here, so we looked at the opposite Resistor.

692 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.710
Which is on 1 and then.

693 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:11.970
We divided by the, uh, add 1.

694 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:22.830
And then we multiply, I put the.

695 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:31.620
We multiply by total so this is the shortcut for the case of.

696 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:40.260
You don't need to use the long, long formula. You just need to use a short formula or sharp card.

697 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.160
For a special case of 2 resistors in parallel.

698 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.060
So this is called current divider rule.

699 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:55.530
So, current state is look at the opposite resistance. Not the current.

700 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:59.730
The, the, it's all resistant you look at the opposite register.

701 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:05.070
Okay, and with that, um.

702 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:10.830
Uh, there a shortcut formula I hope you can you are able to.

703 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:15.840
To answer. Okay, the 1st 1, this is I. S, it's.

704 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.510
Split into this 1 and this 1 split.

705 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:28.890
And, uh, this 1, we call we call the.

706 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:37.230
And what what is the shortcut formulas is if we want to find the we loop.

707 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:42.060
At the opposite with this, uh, resistor, which is 8.

708 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:46.920
And we divide by 4+8 as a total.

709 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.950
And we multiply.

710 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.730
Started source, which is 6.

711 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:57.960
And we get for MTS for.

712 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.140
So, hopefully you can use the same.

713 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.200
Uh, logic and the shortcut formula.

714 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.660
To find, what is I to what is, uh, to.

715 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:19.290
So, what is to do with that? Uh, I will start the the next question.

716 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.980
Which will you have 100 seconds?

717 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:28.710
Uh, to answer that.

718 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:34.680
So, what is the value? What is the steps to find out to.

719 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:59.460
So, data I was just doing the.

720 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:06.120
Formula and the value of, uh.

721 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:12.390
We have the value of icon and, uh, let me see.

722 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:22.140
Some progress very good progress. Uh, 71 students or 70 students.

Close the answer here and the answer is.

730 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:27.270
For divided by 4+8 multiplied by 600.

731 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:31.020
Therefore, it's 2 Mbps.

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:52.320
Listen to.

827 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.640
Wow.

828 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.300
Mhm.

829 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.930
Okay.

830 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:07.620
Oh, no.

831 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:13.350
You have all the.

832 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:17.340
It's not so easy.

833 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:24.630
Hello.

834 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:30.720
How's that?

835 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.370
Yeah.

836 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)

Oh, no.

837 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:44.070
But you can put.

838 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:47.670
The other things.

839 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:51.090
What is the.

840 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:56.640
You know, from from the, um.

841 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:03.660
We're gonna be doing better for now. Yes. Or no, please.

842 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:12.630
You said last week I already Yeah Yeah Yeah, because it doesn't come right? So, Chris yeah.

843 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:15.660
Unless you tell me that.

844 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:20.730
Like, an exception, right? Yeah there were issues and time right right.

845 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:24.630
Uh, and we probably won't solve this 1. no, no.

846 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:27.630
So, it's 2:4:6. yeah.

847 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:31.320
And then after that's.

848 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.760
Thank you. I, it's, it's not go down that.

849 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.630
Do you have the apartment.

850 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:45.030
Huh.

851 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:48.300
.

852 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:51.900
Hello.

853 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)

Yes.

854 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:58.470
Right.

855 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:02.550
Oh.

856 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:07.020
Right.

857 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:12.060
Hello.

858 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:17.880
That's not.

859 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.430
So.

860 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:42.000
So, for tomorrow, we'll be on that, right? So they already announce the person wants to be online, which will be postponed to for them.

861 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.800
Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, next week it'll be written yes, yes. Yes.

862 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:54.450
Cool.

863 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:58.050
The system.

864 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:04.830
This is it right? How many patients it pushed to.

865 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:08.100
Uh, don't.

866 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:11.550
Hello.

867 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:15.720
Hello.

868 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.560
I don't remember.

869 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:31.500
Parking.

870 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:37.020
Yeah, so, um.

871 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:40.590
It's something else.

872 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:44.760
And 8 questions.

873 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.780
Hello.

874 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.870
Fine.

875 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:54.900
There you go.

876 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:59.610
Okay.

877 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:06.360
Oops.

878 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.770
So, we'll come back after the.

879 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:17.430
So, I, let's continue just introductory for there will be no.

880 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:25.830
Uh, online let's check with, we will just for the introductory purpose, and I hope those stock app.

881 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:30.480
Maybe 10:20:something like that, so that you can.

882 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.770
And prepared for your written, please.

883 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:41.070
For the written, please, uh, uh, it is not it's, uh, written.

884 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:47.370
And they, uh, 8 questions, uh, for.

885 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:53.370
So, electronically, just now, we have learned.

886 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:59.220
Several seconds and current divider. So, in that, your call.

887 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:02.400
Uh, we are going to learn a combination.

888 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.320
Of serious in the circle is a combination of series and.

889 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.920
We also we learned about the current source.

890 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:15.600
The current voltage soft and analysis.

891 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:24.120
So, if you see in the parallels parallel set that in the previous lecture.

892 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:27.390
In here, we can see that.

893 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:38.340
Uh, there is a, a mixture or a series to parallel. 2nd, it's a combination of series.

894 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:42.240
And and better.

895 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:47.910
So, quick, for example, uh, you have to.

896 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:51.840
That's usually we tackle from the right.

897 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:57.089
Right. Okay. Okay. So if we draw, uh, this.

898 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:31:57.089 --> 01:32:03.449
Uh, this side this side, actually, it is.

899 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:03.449 --> 01:32:08.789
Uh, like, 3.

900 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:13.229
Um, for like this.

901 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:19.559
Because if you bring up 3 here, so, in the way that, uh, this is.

902 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:19.559 --> 01:32:24.329
Are 3 and 4 in series.

903 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:24.329 --> 01:32:29.009
Are 3 and our 4 in cities, but they are in parallel.

904 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:29.009 --> 01:32:41.249
We have 2, so where do we see a mix of series emperor? The strategy or the is we look at the right hand side.

905 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:41.249 --> 01:32:45.179
We tried to to make it simpler.

906 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:45.179 --> 01:32:49.949
Is it here we can see that all 3 and our for, uh, in series.

907 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:49.949 --> 01:32:56.489
Uh, overview of the whole this branch, so I will.

908 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:32:56.489 --> 01:33:04.529
Right. Different colors. So these are 3 or 4 together is branch is in parallel.

909 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:04.529 --> 01:33:08.939
To add to it.

910 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:11.999
And when we.

911 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:11.999 --> 01:33:15.299
Have to I would do it in a different color.

912 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:20.609
Maybe after you combined, uh, all this.

913 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:20.609 --> 01:33:26.609
So, in a big 1 in in red color, so here.

914 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:29.819 --> 01:33:36.419
Here is 1, so when we combined.

915 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:36.419 --> 01:33:44.849
Uh, uh, I just joined like, this, the, the rate box.

916 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:44.849 --> 01:33:52.019
It's a red box is here and this is the.

917 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:52.019 --> 01:33:57.749
The battery, or about this plan so you can see the red box.

918 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:33:57.749 --> 01:34:01.379
Is in series with.

919 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:01.379 --> 01:34:08.849
So, here, maybe I draw is to this, the red box.

920 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:08.849 --> 01:34:14.819
This is red box in series with as a whole so we.

921 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:14.819 --> 01:34:21.179
Strategize it by looking for the right hand side and then we move towards the left hand side.

922 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:21.179 --> 01:34:30.419
Okay, you can see that. Um, so here is the what we have done just now.

923 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:30.419 --> 01:34:42.749
And so what we have done, just now, we, we take, uh, we look at the right hands, right hand side of the sector on. They are in series.

924 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:42.749 --> 01:34:47.549
So, we call them our desk, but.

925 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:47.549 --> 01:34:52.319
Our Prime is in parallel with so we.

926 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:34:52.319 --> 01:35:00.329
We call it cause our prime is in parallel. It's the symbol of parallel with part 2.

927 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:00.329 --> 01:35:06.779
So, to, and as a result that we call it our, the dash or empty Prime.

928 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:06.779 --> 01:35:12.509
And R, D Prime is in series with 1.

929 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:12.509 --> 01:35:16.679
So, when they are serious with.

930 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:16.679 --> 01:35:22.469
We just call it because they are in series. So dash.

931 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:22.469 --> 01:35:41.939
Plus so make it as 1 resistance, uh, R, D in total. So if we have make it simple for us, so we have, uh, E and 1, big box or 1 big resistance of the and it's easy to solve the 2nd, using the old slow, slow.

932 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:52.799
So this is, uh, a combination of resistance in federal and.

933 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:52.799 --> 01:35:58.889
So, this, uh, example is also a combination of resistance.

934 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:35:58.889 --> 01:36:03.119
In parallel and series, um.

935 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:03.119 --> 01:36:07.769
Uh, what is the best 2:5:I 3.

936 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:07.769 --> 01:36:12.269
What do you think what we've learned in lecture 3? Just now.

937 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:17.399 --> 01:36:24.389
The theme here is to use, uh, voltage, uh, divider.

938 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:24.389 --> 01:36:27.419
Without, uh, determining.

939 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:27.419 --> 01:36:30.839
The source code, so they are.

940 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:30.839 --> 01:36:35.669
I understand that there are many approaches, but let's.

941 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:40.229
Uh, let us see here, let us see.

942 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:43.649 --> 01:36:48.179
So, we, uh, us to find.

943 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:48.179 --> 01:36:53.219
So, we are asked to find 3, so.

944 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:36:53.219 --> 01:37:05.759
1st of all we know that, uh, are 2, and our 3 are in parallel, which is symbol of parallel. We call it.

945 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:05.759 --> 01:37:09.599
So are 2 and 3 are in parallel.

946 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:09.599 --> 01:37:14.249
We call it our prime. So do you still remember.

947 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:14.249 --> 01:37:17.429
Uh, this shortcut formula, if we have.

948 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:17.429 --> 01:37:26.099
To resist the only 2 resistors specialties in parallel we can use the shortcut formula to find the.

949 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:26.099 --> 01:37:30.899
Our total so the shortcut formula is.

950 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:30.899 --> 01:37:39.209
12 multiplied by 6 divided by 12+6 so I will bring you back to the previous.

951 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:39.209 --> 01:37:45.659
Previous lecture where special case?

952 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:50.129
Of 2 resisters in parallel.

953 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:50.129 --> 01:37:54.659
You can use.

954 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:54.659 --> 01:37:58.229
The shortcut formula.

955 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:37:58.229 --> 01:38:06.599
So the short term formula, if you only have to resist this in parallel to find out the, the blue box.

956 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:06.599 --> 01:38:14.459
Is multiply by divided by plus or 2 so we are doing that at this moment.

957 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:14.459 --> 01:38:18.899
Use the short, short formula, so our prime.

958 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:18.899 --> 01:38:22.169
Is, uh, 12xby 6.

959 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:22.169 --> 01:38:28.229
Divided by 12+6 therefore, our prime.

960 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:35.459
This is is so this.

961 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:35.459 --> 01:38:39.089
As the upfront is actually in series.

962 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:39.089 --> 01:38:42.479
With 2:2:kilowatts.

963 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:42.479 --> 01:38:46.439
So, 2 kilowatts is here is here.

964 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:46.439 --> 01:38:55.889
So, therefore, um, this are in series, so we can put a simplify it.

965 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:38:55.889 --> 01:39:00.659
We call it 6 because 2 6.

966 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:00.659 --> 01:39:04.319
16 alarms, so.

967 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:07.409
Now, we have 54 votes.

968 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:15.269
54 votes we have 6 homes. Therefore I total.

969 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:15.269 --> 01:39:19.649
Is 54 law.

970 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:19.649 --> 01:39:24.359
I thought is, uh, we own our, the 54 volts.

971 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:24.359 --> 01:39:35.189
Divided by the 6, so I total is 9,000,000.

972 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:38.819
9.

973 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:38.819 --> 01:39:42.929
So, now we, we got to right here.

974 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:42.929 --> 01:39:50.039
9Million Mbps now we use the principle of current divider. Okay.

975 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:50.039 --> 01:39:55.529
Current divider, because remember in the last.

976 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:39:55.529 --> 01:40:01.589
1, hour ago, we know that the current if this is 9,000,000.

977 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:04.889
It will split out it will split.

978 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:04.889 --> 01:40:08.069
To, and we use.

979 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:08.069 --> 01:40:12.959
The current divide a formula, so in the previous lecture.

980 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:12.959 --> 01:40:17.849
Special case for the 2.

981 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:17.849 --> 01:40:24.599
In parallel, we can use the special case formula.

982 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:24.599 --> 01:40:32.159
To find the current of, uh, if there are 2 resistance in parallel, we can use this.

983 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:37.409
Current divide the rule formula, so we can now.

984 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:37.409 --> 01:40:41.219
So, because we are asked to find i3.

985 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:51.539
You did the quiz just now when we find I T, looks at the opposite resistor, which is 12.

986 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:51.539 --> 01:40:55.259
Divided by 12+6.

987 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:40:55.259 --> 01:41:00.929
Multiply by 9. the 900 is that.

988 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:00.929 --> 01:41:09.989
The sauce, therefore, we opt in the answer s.

989 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:09.989 --> 01:41:15.659
6, really 6,000,000.

990 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:15.659 --> 01:41:19.589
So, i3 is 6,000,000.

991 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:26.999
So here we use current divider knowledge, we use, uh, we, we use.

992 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:26.999 --> 01:41:30.179
That will re, a series resist.

993 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:30.179 --> 01:41:33.569
Combination.

994 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:33.569 --> 01:41:37.889
I don't know.

995 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:37.889 --> 01:41:47.369
Yes, I think, uh, you you are.

996 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:47.369 --> 01:41:51.149
Get off the police today because.

997 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:41:51.149 --> 01:42:01.409
Uh, the University, I believe we announce online learning because of the weather on Thursday and Friday. So, those who have to.

998 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:01.409 --> 01:42:10.199
That's the session they have to postpone it to next Thursday. So, but I think it's better for you.

999 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:13.739
Get off we don't don't delay do it today.

1000 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:13.739 --> 01:42:20.159
Uh, and we will get good marks, I believe, because, uh, it's only week 1 week.

1001 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:40.159
So, um, so, um, but you already here, I already announced it, so you will not run away. Just kidding. Don't go for the next Thursday. So you are you, you should, uh, I think, in my opinion, you should do now.

1002 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:40.159 --> 01:42:47.279
Uh, but for tomorrow students, they will need to do it, uh, next week in week. 4.

1003 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:47.279 --> 01:42:53.069
Because tomorrow and Friday, and, uh, let's just, uh, the clusters will be online.

1004 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:53.069 --> 01:42:57.689
So, we're just, um.

1005 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:42:57.689 --> 01:43:05.009
All clusters at the university will announce it that all the, uh, clusters with your name.

1006 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:05.009 --> 01:43:11.099
Due to the expected, uh, weather.

1007 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:11.099 --> 01:43:20.099
Uh, Labs will be announced whether they are replacement or their future with an, whether replace again or do some online things.

1008 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:26.009 --> 01:43:29.099
Okay and, um, so.

1009 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:29.099 --> 01:43:33.479
Intermittent, uh, I4, um.

1010 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:33.479 --> 01:43:37.319
In this order, the means 1st, we need them in art form.

1011 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:37.319 --> 01:43:45.629
Then we need to mean a week 2, and that we determine 5:5:So we need to use all our.

1012 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:50.069
Experience, uh, knowledge that we have learned, uh.

1013 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:50.069 --> 01:43:58.769
Series current divider, voltage divider in order to solve this 2nd, in order to solve these seconds.

1014 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:43:58.769 --> 01:44:05.489
And, uh, so, um.

1015 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:05.489 --> 01:44:11.399
So, let's get, I mean, I focus, so here we have.

1016 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:11.399 --> 01:44:17.669
These 2, in parallel this 2 in parallel out to an, in parallel.

1017 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:22.439
But they are in series, 2 and 1.

1018 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:22.439 --> 01:44:27.089
Which is this branch in series? 2 I form.

1019 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:27.089 --> 01:44:30.839
So, can I ask you I for is.

1020 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:30.839 --> 01:44:38.909
What do you think is the best, uh, the best way immediately with a, uh, I mean, uh, if you know that the, uh, what is iPhone.

1021 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:38.909 --> 01:44:42.989
Which, which, uh, you you can use easily.

1022 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:46.679 --> 01:44:51.029
I don't even know what suggestion.

1023 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:44:55.019 --> 01:45:04.649
Maybe, it's about why the voltage don't use this environment. So good idea. So you can see.

1024 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:04.649 --> 01:45:08.789
I will join a different color, so.

1025 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:08.789 --> 01:45:14.519
Uh, this, uh, it's like a series uh, they are W, what branch.

1026 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:14.519 --> 01:45:20.609
This is 1 branch so this blue and blue is in parallel.

1027 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:20.609 --> 01:45:24.179
What do we say if the voltage.

1028 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:24.179 --> 01:45:28.229
Uh, in parallel they are the same.

1029 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:32.369
So, I follow.

1030 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:32.369 --> 01:45:40.559
Is all in this branch is the voltage divided by the resistance.

1031 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:40.559 --> 01:45:43.709
So, if this is 12 volts.

1032 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:49.739
This blue branch also 12 goals. This blue is 12 months.

1033 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:49.739 --> 01:45:58.079
So this, uh, 12 votes, and of course, I fall is flowing here and the resist in.

1034 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:45:58.079 --> 01:46:02.489
4 is 8.2.

1035 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:09.389
So, we look up, of course, there are many ways and, uh, current divider or these are.

1036 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:09.389 --> 01:46:22.979
And then we will get the same answer, but look at the same, uh, overall picture and try to get the easiest, simplest way. Okay. Implicitly.

1037 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:22.979 --> 01:46:32.069
And so, um, so here I can see, 12 books is 12. this is 12. this is.

1038 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:32.069 --> 01:46:41.999
Uh, 12. okay, this is 12. so I fought is 12 votes divided by 8.2kilo homes, which, uh, which means.

1039 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:41.999 --> 01:46:48.269
I thought is 1.430001.4 3.

1040 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:48.269 --> 01:46:54.209
We have this now, let's try we to.

1041 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:46:54.209 --> 01:47:02.189
Need to, so what is the best we do that? V2.

1042 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:06.329
What is that? There are many ways. What do you think is.

1043 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:06.329 --> 01:47:14.579
Uh, what is your, uh, strategy? What is your strategy in order to get a way to.

1044 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:18.389 --> 01:47:23.519
So 1 way is because, uh, we do.

1045 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:23.519 --> 01:47:26.909
Uh, is, uh.

1046 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:26.909 --> 01:47:30.209
Multiply by the resistance, right?

1047 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:30.209 --> 01:47:34.199
So, the current, um.

1048 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:34.199 --> 01:47:42.929
These 2 are in, uh, this, uh, R2 and, uh, 3, uh, in parallel. I think you agree.

1049 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:42.929 --> 01:47:48.599
Are 2 and 3 are in parallel.

1050 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:48.599 --> 01:47:52.979
Um, in serious summit.

1051 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:52.979 --> 01:47:56.579
What 55.

1052 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:47:56.579 --> 01:48:03.539
Yes, so there are many ways. So what I you can do is you can say that.

1053 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:03.539 --> 01:48:06.899
18 and 2 kilowatts.

1054 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:06.899 --> 01:48:13.919
Ah, in parallel, I think, you know, how to get the thought of.

1055 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:13.919 --> 01:48:18.179
The resistance for that parallel.

1056 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:18.179 --> 01:48:23.339
Which is the special formula 18.

1057 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:23.339 --> 01:48:28.799
Multiply by 2 divided by 18+2.

1058 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:28.799 --> 01:48:33.989
You will update, um.

1059 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:33.989 --> 01:48:38.579
You will update, um, 1.

1060 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:38.579 --> 01:48:43.139
Point it 1.8kilohertz.

1061 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:43.139 --> 01:48:49.589
Yes, yep the adjusts by the error. What.

1062 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (35057408)
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:54.479
