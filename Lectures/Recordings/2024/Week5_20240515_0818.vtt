Thank you.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:28.549
Hello.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:41.009
1.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:50.249
It's part of the electronic.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:53.639
Start from.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:59.729
Writing no, no, not not.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:17.879
The last 2.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:21.929
Hello.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:34.739
Take care.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:59.689
Hello.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:08.039
Hello.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:16.109 --> 00:13:21.239
Hello.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.929
Good morning. Oh, cool. Everyone is good.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:32.519
Here, let's do it.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:42.179
So, we will, we will start with our lecture 5, and I hope to.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.709
Earlier, so that we have some.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:50.879
Um, some time to revise for the.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:54.179
With the exact midterm exam will start on.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:58.229
10 3010 30.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:06.359
In today's lecture facts, we are going to learn superposition.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:12.539
And equivalence and.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:16.409
What does the superposition States?

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:23.159
It states that the current through or voltage across any element of a network is equal.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:27.599
To the algebraic, some of the currents of voltages produce.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:31.169
Independently by.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:35.339
So, we have, um.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:39.779
Have you guys have seen, uh, you have seen in the past 5 weeks?

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:45.689
There are several more than 1 method to solve, uh, 2nd, problems.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:45.689 --> 00:14:56.879
So, in this situation, we are going to learn another method, which is called Super position.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:00.929
So, in, uh.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:04.499
You can see in this circuit here.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:04.499 --> 00:15:11.129
We have to resist us what voltage sauce and 1 current sauce. Okay.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:17.279
1 current source, so from the name.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.939
The support position means we focus.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:25.139
On 1 source, we remove the other sauce.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:29.399
We do whatever it is required.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:33.299
And that we focus on the other source.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:39.269
We remove, uh, the other 1 and we do whatever and then.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:45.539
At the end, we add both of them together so that is that's why it's called superposition.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:50.549
So, if we have here, we have 2 sources.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:54.269
I work at sauce and sauce, so.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:57.719
The strategy is when you.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:03.479
When you want to focus on the current source.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:08.399
Therefore, you must remove the voltage sauce.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:12.449
Be moving removing the voltage sauce means.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:12.449 --> 00:16:18.629
Replacing the voltage sauce with, uh, short circuit.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:25.709
A straight line if we want to focus on the voltage sauce.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:29.129
We will remove the current source.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:38.249
And by removing the current sauce, we are replacing the current sauce with an open circuit.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:44.639
So, why why what is the strategy means? This means we.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:47.969
When we remove, uh, 1 of the sauce.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:47.969 --> 00:16:52.589
Now, we can do whatever like calculations.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:59.879
Um, for example, voltage current and so forth, and we take note of the answer.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:05.339
And we now focus on the other source, which is current source.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.649
And we remove the voltage sauce.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:15.959
Plus by removing devoted sauce, we are replacing it with.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:20.699
A short circuit, which means a simple 1.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:24.359
Simple wire there at the end.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.409
After we do, uh, our operations.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:35.579
We get the results and, uh, for this case, we do our calculations and operations. We get the results.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:41.129
And that we add superposition means we add, uh, this results.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:44.429
To do these results to get.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:49.379
To get the final correct answer.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:49.379 --> 00:17:55.409
So that is the concept of superposition and the name is, makes it easy.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:59.729
To to understand the logic, because we.

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:17:59.729 --> 00:18:05.399
We act, uh, both results together. That's why it is called Super position.

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:12.599
It's best to to look at some examples.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:17.729
So, the theory of superposition means that.

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:21.029
If we have if you want to remove.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:27.569
What takes us we are going to replace it with a short 2nd.

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:27.569 --> 00:18:31.679
If we are going to remove current sauce.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:36.239
We are going we are going to replace it with an open a 2nd.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:46.079
With an open 2nd, so let's look at 1 example of superposition. So, as, you know.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:50.669
Um, we were asked to find Karen, I, to.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:54.689
So this is I do in this branch.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:58.259
In this branch in this, uh, in this branch.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:18:58.259 --> 00:19:02.849
So, I know that there are several ways to solve it.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:02.849 --> 00:19:06.269
Is using maybe you want to convert.

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:10.799
The work that sauce to become current sauce in parallel.

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:17.009
So that parallel current source can be added. So that is also valued.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:22.619
But today we are going to learn a new technique, which is.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:27.389
Uh, support position Kyoto.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:32.219
Superposition to Europe. So superposition States the 1st step is.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:38.309
To focus on 1 source and remove the other source.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:42.299
The next step is to focus on.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:48.029
Current sauce and remove the voltage. So so now we are doing this.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:57.929
Okay, now we start this position. 0, so we are now focusing on, uh, what the sauce and removing the current sauce.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:02.579
So, when we focus on the.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:07.199
So, the theory states that when we removed the current.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:12.449
We replace it with an open. 2nd.

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:12.449 --> 00:20:18.209
So, we, we, we, we, we replace it with open a 2nd, so I just.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:18.209 --> 00:20:25.379
Go back to the theory. So re, replace all any current process with open circuits.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:29.969
We've open seconds. No. So now this is open.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:29.969 --> 00:20:33.299
And so.

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:38.219
We, we will ask originally to find, uh, I do.

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:43.319
So, i2 is here, so it looks like.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:48.209
Let's use mesh mesh.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:51.419
Uh, uh.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:56.339
This means, um, or you can use, um.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:20:56.339 --> 00:21:02.759
After you viewing this, you can observe that. This is.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:06.659
Uh, simply, uh, series.

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:21.149
A series a resistor cause this is open circuit. So this is normal. Uh, no more relevant. So we all.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:24.809
You only have this with, uh, 12 homes.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:30.419
And 6:00:00, um.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:38.579
We were asked to find the I do, but we don't call I too, because I do is the final we just for.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:44.849
So, not to confuse because we need to do the other 1 to add them together.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:49.949
And here, we can see it at 6 volts.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:55.439
So, I do in series, I think you agree with me.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:59.879
This is a serious occur law states that.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:03.119
I do that. Sorry?

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:07.979
I, I.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:13.619
We call it dash so not to confuse with the final answer that required a voltage.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:18.809
Over total resistance.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:23.039
So, we got 2 Mbps so we take note.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:27.479
That by removing the current sauce.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:30.629
Maintaining the what the sauce.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:30.629 --> 00:22:37.019
Uh, we got 2 for the eye to eye 2 dash.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:42.239
So, the next step is now we go back to the original.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:46.349
Now, we maintain the current source.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:46.349 --> 00:22:51.449
And we remove the voltage source. Mm. Hmm.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:51.449 --> 00:22:58.259
Now, the next step is to remove the, what results and maintain the current source.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:05.219
So, now we are doing that, so, and the theory states, so we are now focusing on the current source.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:08.369
And removing the voltage sauce.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:18.779
Moving to market source the workday source will be replaced by, uh, or the straight wire.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:24.479
And that in mind, we need to find the I, to, which is.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:28.049
In, uh, in.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:31.709
This branch, so let's look.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:36.599
Let's look here, so we can also some, um.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:43.949
Some things that we can use, we can put, uh, the R1.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:43.949 --> 00:23:48.329
Here the, you can put here.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:51.359
Uh, is still here.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:56.609
I'm still here and this is.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:23:56.609 --> 00:24:01.529
The current the current source.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:01.529 --> 00:24:08.609
And the current, uh, current sauce is 9.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:08.609 --> 00:24:11.939
Therefore, these 9 we flow here.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:15.389 --> 00:24:19.139
And I will flow here and you can observe.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:27.509
You can use current divider theory, because this current will flow to this junction. It will be split.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:35.249
2:2:colors, but we are more interested to find the i2. That's the.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:39.269
Request in the question, so.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:44.159
This we call it out to dash dash dash.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:49.229
Uh, just to not to confuse, because I do is, I will find the answer.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:49.229 --> 00:24:54.869
And I will write here 12 homes.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:24:54.869 --> 00:25:00.119
This is 6 hours so I hope you.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:03.929
You still remember the special formula.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:07.199
For the current divider theory.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.889
We'll get, uh, I do in this branch.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:10.889 --> 00:25:18.329
So, I do, but we don't try to to avoid confusion. We call.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:18.329 --> 00:25:22.619
If we look at the opposite branch.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:26.489
Which is 12 volts divide that.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:26.489 --> 00:25:31.979
By the total, which is 6+12.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:31.979 --> 00:25:36.479
Uh, multiply the total color, which is 9. 0.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:46.829
And when we do that calculation is 6.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:46.829 --> 00:25:51.839
So, we take the to Prime.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:56.549
From the previous answer, which is to.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:25:56.549 --> 00:26:04.589
To, and, uh, I to double Prime that we just update, which is 6.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:04.589 --> 00:26:09.809
And superposition Europe means.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:18.389
We add this 2 2+6 to get the final answer.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:21.389
Get the final answer so that is.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:24.509
The technique of Super position.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:27.659
So, um.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:30.839
I understand that, uh.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:36.899
There are different ways to solve the. You can also.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:40.379
Convert the voltage sauce and this.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:44.399
Register to become current source and register in parallel.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:51.689
And to that, uh, parallel sauce can be added together because that's the theory that we have learned.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:51.689 --> 00:26:54.869
And so forth, but.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:26:54.869 --> 00:27:02.429
This is another technique, a, another strategy, which is called the Super position.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:06.959
Super position, so superposition terror means.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:13.589
Focus each current source was that the 1st step is to focus.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:13.589 --> 00:27:19.229
The, uh, what the sauce so we focus it.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:19.229 --> 00:27:22.889
But we remove the current source.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:22.889 --> 00:27:29.249
So, the current source is removed, but we, you need to remember what the current sauce.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:34.649
Is removed and replaced by, uh, open 2nd.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:38.549
Can we do whatever is possible to find.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:41.789
The in this branch.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:46.109
In this and they are series, so no issue.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:53.039
After that we take note of the answer, uh, I thought we call it to dash is 2 Mbps.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:58.379
Then now we, the next step, the next step is.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:27:58.379 --> 00:28:02.489
To focus on the current sauce.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:02.489 --> 00:28:06.359
And remove the voltage sauce.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:11.339
And do whatever permission to find I do.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:16.769
Uh, this branch, but removing you must remember that removing.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:23.609
The voltage source will be, it will be replaced by a short circuit while.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:30.779
Removing the previously, removing the current sauce will be replaced by an open 2nd, removing.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:35.189
The voltage sauce will be replaced with a shot so good. 1. yeah.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:35.189 --> 00:28:40.799
So, after, uh, performing that removal.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:44.729
This is the next slide shows that.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:44.729 --> 00:28:48.179
We are now focusing on the current source.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:54.239
And removing the voltage source and replacing with the short circuit strict wire.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:28:54.239 --> 00:29:00.119
And we try to see what is available so that we can get I, to.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:04.469
I do rubber prime and we use a divided theory.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:08.189
To get it to double prime at 6.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:08.189 --> 00:29:14.369
So, we take note of the answers both answers and then.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:14.369 --> 00:29:19.139
From the what superposition this means we act.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:19.139 --> 00:29:22.499
The previous answer of Prime.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:22.499 --> 00:29:29.669
With the this answer of 6 2+6 M.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:33.059
Becomes it so this.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:42.149
Is our final answer for the to using Super position Europe using support?

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:48.449 --> 00:29:51.479
Is able to support position.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:29:51.479 --> 00:30:00.809
Okay, this is another example of superposition.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:05.549
So, we have here, uh, we have.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:11.759
We want to find I do, and we have here 2 voltage sources.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:20.099
So, to what the process, no problem we can still use Super. So the 1st step is to focus.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:20.099 --> 00:30:24.329
On 1 of them and removing.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:28.949
Uh, this 1, but removing this 1.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:28.949 --> 00:30:36.569
Going to be replaced by, uh, both, uh, short, straight, quiet.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:41.009
And do whatever is possible.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:44.219
To find I to call it time to time.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:48.449
And then after that focus on the next.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:48.449 --> 00:30:53.129
After doing the patient focus on the 48.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:53.129 --> 00:30:58.109
48 volts added sauce removing.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:05.639
54 current sauce and removing uh, sorry removing the 50 for both the sauce.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:05.639 --> 00:31:10.349
Removing about the sauce replacing with a short circuit.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:10.349 --> 00:31:13.409
Straight, so that is.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:13.409 --> 00:31:21.269
The, the concept of superposition Super position.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:30.359
So, let us move, uh, let us start with the 1st step. So we are now just focusing on the 54 votes with the sauce.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:33.929
And removing the.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:33.929 --> 00:31:40.229
48 volts will the sauce and replacing it with a short circuit straight Wired.

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:40.229 --> 00:31:44.669
It short circuit, straight line, and we tried to.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:48.329
Fine, uh, I to Prime.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:53.069
Yeah, at the end is I too, but not to be confused.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:56.549
And answer, we call it I to Prime.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:31:56.549 --> 00:32:02.519
And you can see here, this is a short circuit. Why? So, why not.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:05.669
In, uh, for for the best view.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:09.599
Why not we put we draw the for goes into here.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:15.479
Uh, we draw the post it to here and we can see.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:15.479 --> 00:32:21.839
This is a parallel a, this is a parallel resistance.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:28.919
Uh, parallel resistance and.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:33.539
So, when it is parallel, so let's do go back.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:45.089
So, I will, uh, look in here.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:52.049
Steps as a, uh, drawing in 1 page is better to see a overall picture.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:32:55.349 --> 00:33:11.849
Slower.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:11.849 --> 00:33:18.029
So, the 1st, the 1st, uh, this is our original original 2nd.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:24.989
So, we now focus on the 54 votes, uh, what the sauce and we, we.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:29.579
Remove the 48 W, what you saw by replacing it with.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:34.259
So, good, why are you? Good while.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:37.979 --> 00:33:41.339
Okay, and here you can.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:44.489
That is.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:54.209
This is just Wired, so why not? We drawing in this matter. So we can see it more. Clearly. We can see that the 12 herbs and the forms.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:57.509
Uh, I don't know, right. Ah, in parallel.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:01.259
So, they are in parallel, I hope you now.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:07.589
Uh, you know, that to, to resistance in parallel, because it will also come.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:11.939
In the victim at 10, 30.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:16.979
To resist this in parallel, but of course, you should never forget.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:22.589
The long formula our team is 1 over.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:26.249
What over our work and and so forth.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:26.249 --> 00:34:31.469
But here, we can observe that 12 hours and photos.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:36.869
Uh, to multiply, by, for 12+4 is equivalent to.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:41.459
3, okay.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:41.459 --> 00:34:49.319
So, this we want to get, uh.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:49.319 --> 00:34:56.729
Uh, which is here, uh, I want.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:34:56.729 --> 00:35:04.559
And I want, uh, we know 54 votes, you know, serious resistance, 24 and 3.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:08.909
We will say that I want is to.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:12.689
So, now we can go back to do the.

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:12.689 --> 00:35:19.469
Previous 1, and we know that I want is to.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:25.709
So, in the past 1 or 2 weeks, we always be the example.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:28.799
Uh, if we have this look at the rights.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:33.149
With all the resistance as 1 and then.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:33.149 --> 00:35:40.109
Yeah, I I saw and that is going to come in the meet them as well.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:46.499
So this is the benefit because you cannot this 1, this 1 you come, but the concept of.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:46.499 --> 00:35:52.769
The total resistance, and then to find the source.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:52.769 --> 00:35:58.379
So this means when we know is to we go back to here.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:35:58.379 --> 00:36:02.009
Now, we can use the current divider theory.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:02.009 --> 00:36:05.759
+2 Mbps we want.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:05.759 --> 00:36:11.279
Uh, I to Prime, so I hope you still remember the current.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:17.099
Divide the theory, because it's the current divide theory is also in the midterm exam.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:25.259
But we are going to practice now, the current provider theory for a special to resist the in parallel.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:25.259 --> 00:36:30.959
That's practice now also good for the midterm exam.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:36.389
Current divided duty, but this will not come Super position on this but.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:36.389 --> 00:36:39.569
We can see that each question we need to use.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:39.569 --> 00:36:42.839
How to divide the theory? Uh.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:47.819
In parallel to make it a total and so forth.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:47.819 --> 00:36:52.379
So, it will be that, um, I will test.

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:57.869
And as a practice for the victim exam as well.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:02.339
So, I will show, uh, it is it, uh.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:06.599
Let's just pull them in the lectures for the.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:11.879
And you will see 1024, uh, in class quiz.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:16.619
Uh, lecture 5, uh, Wednesday to 5.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:20.849
So.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:20.849 --> 00:37:27.209
If I click this and I will call.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:27.209 --> 00:37:34.979
Wednesday, 15th of May, uh, 2024.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:34.979 --> 00:37:39.509
Wednesday, 15th of May 24.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:48.119
Okay, so I did not start yet.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:54.419
So, uh, the question that we are going to ask them is.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:59.669
So, if we have here.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:37:59.669 --> 00:38:07.409
So, if we have it, now, go, it is to it split into 2.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:07.409 --> 00:38:10.649
All right what we are interested.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:15.870
To use the.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.340
Uh, which I believe you remember because this current divided theory.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.220
Will be in the midterm exam the current.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:36.090
And so let's start the quiz and you will have 200 seconds before. This is the 1st question.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:44.190
Quiz is in the lecture folder, uh, 2024 in class, uh, lecture 5.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:48.510
Where is the intellectual photos?

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.830
And you can say, 2024.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:57.510
In class, please let your 5 bracket. Uh, when is the.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.170
Let's see here.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:07.380
We have, uh, the current provider theory to get eye to dash.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.600
I too dash.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.200
So, uh, you need to.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.220
Familiarized with current theory resistance in.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.000
Mm, hmm.

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.220
Huh.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.600
Um, very faster.

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.170
Very fast. Okay. Now, why I will repeat the question.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:54.000
But, uh, thank you for telling so I will 1st.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.600
Um, why is the, uh.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:06.060
Close the session and start a new session. Don't worry, uh, close the session.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.700
Start a new session, and I will change the timer. Okay.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.190
The time, uh, let me check what happened to the timer.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:24.810
The 1st question.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:28.050
Okay, 200 seconds.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:33.690
Okay, 200 seconds the 1st, the 2nd question.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:48.720
100 seconds, sorry for the 40 for for this, uh, on site and 100 seconds.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:57.270
We only have less question today because.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:05.100
You don't have to we just want to do to practice for the with them and that's the case.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.050
The 5th questions.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:14.970
106.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:19.080
six thirty pm is one hundred 

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:25.620
It gets so.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:31.860
So, let's start a new, a new.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.860
A new session, so I will.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.920
Here again, uh, in class, which.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.680
Start the new session, the real, the real, the real 1.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.630
Let me see.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:53.760
16 may 2024.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:04.560
So this new session, uh, and, uh, so now you will have 200 seconds on the 1st question.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.790
And the question is for fine, I to dash.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:40.710
Yes, um.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:48.930
So, you currently Weiner theory, you should familiarize for the midterm exam exam our total.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:57.390
Special formula for 2:2:registers in parallel to get the, you should familiarize.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:05.250
Uh, current divided theory, special formula for 2 resistance in parallel. You should also.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:15.450
For the victim exam, uh, no data analytics you should familiarize for the exam.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:20.820
Currently what, uh, Jodi voltage divider duty.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:27.330
So, okay, so this means, uh, I, is.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:36.120
0.5Mbps so keep keep track of this result because we are going to use and the final results.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.450
So, now the 2nd step is to.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:57.330
To focus on the 48 volts and to remove the 54 box voltage. So when we focus on the 4 tables and remove the 54 volts, what is supply and replacing by a short circuit.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.020
Why are we have this situation.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:10.500
So, we, we still want to find I, to what we call it to double Prime. So that not to confuse with the other.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:17.640
I to so, here we can see 24 hours we to have a better view. We draw it here.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:25.260
24 hours, and here is 12 goals and here is 48 volts, but.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.550
The polarity is the opposite and here is for bones.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:33.930
So, again, we use the same technique.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:41.160
This technique will need to be used in the midterm in the midterm.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.660
Of course, not superposition with copy the victim, but as a whole.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.980
Because 1st, you need to summarize all the.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:55.080
All the resistance, so that you can get the.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:01.680
So the 24 hours and 12 OEMs are to resist this in parallel.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.230
We can use the special formula for the 2 resistance in parallel to get the.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:14.640
It was as a total for owns for all 3. so now it's easy to get the.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.170
Because they, uh, these 2 resisters are in serious.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.620
And use all slow, I thought is.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.610
But, please be careful because of the polarities.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.840
So, -48 volts divided by.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:35.760
Uh, folks, so we have .

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.030
Or empty, so take note of that to access.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.440
Uh, this was.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.910
To prime and.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.150
So, it's not your answer. Sorry? Because this is.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:58.170
I saw I saw, okay, then we go back to our.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.290
So, I thought it's minus for.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:05.610
Or oh, I saw now he use back.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:12.510
We now we want to find I to prime and, you know, this is the total current -4 and.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:18.450
You use the current divider theory again so this is good practice for the midterm exam.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:23.880
Because there will be several divided duty.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.050
And now let us, um.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:33.450
Fine, I to Prime, using the current directory. What is.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.600
I do Brian. I do fine.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.760
And so with that, so that's very good.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.000
That's a good answer. And.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.010
Previous question is very good. So now I to try I to double prime i2 number back.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:08.700
So, I, to double fine. So currently by the theory.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:18.330
Uh, I to double time, so I don't mind. I give.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:22.650
And the answers, so you can do. So, okay, I have to double plan.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:42.420
Is look at the opposite current, uh, opposite register, 24 divided by total, which is 24+12xby the total current -4 Mbps. So I, to double plan is -2.6 7 Mbps plus but not least.

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:49.590
Um, the name itself is super position Euro so the, the results that we obtain.

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:55.140
Well, I to Prime, this is 0.5.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:00.360
And I, to double plan because it is negative. So it's.

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:09.480
In here in this direction as 267, and as a total we add them together, which is.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:16.740
2.1722.6 7.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.280
0.5but, the direction is upwards.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:31.710
So, we yes, please.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:37.770
Very good, uh, reservation .

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:49.590
Because this 12 and this is 24. okay. Okay. Have to be slightly more uh.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:55.590
Absolutely that 12, 34.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:00.150
Um, so, uh, this is our.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.330
Technique or Super position.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:08.370
Uh, very good and so at the end.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.880
Uh, our final answer is I to.

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:21.360
Because we add these 2 together, so 2.67-0.5 is 2.17and I do is in this direction.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:30.570
So 1 more example of using, uh.

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:41.940
So, we have here 1 voltage sauce, 9 books and 1, current sauce and 6Million Mbps and we were asked to find I do.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.120
And we were asked to find so.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.720
Fine, I do using Super position 0 If in the future exam, the final exam.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:49:51.720 --> 00:50:02.490
If the question says, uh, find using Super position, so you need to use superposition theater. But if the question says find.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.560
So, it's, uh, you are free to choose the best technique.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:14.460
The you are convenient with it.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:20.790
So, here we can withdraw, uh, redraw this, uh, this 2nd.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:28.050
To be, uh, in this manner in this manner, but actually.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.700
There is, uh, 9 volts here.

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:40.950
And 9 books, but, okay, we do, we draw it, but now we go to the next step, which is.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:45.360
We focus on the current sauce and we.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:58.620
Remove the voltage SaaS 9 volts and according to the order, if you remove all the sauce, you need to replace it with, uh, short circuit wire straight.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:03.060
So, now I'll just do this, so okay.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.870
So, and our objective is to find.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:10.740
I too, so we right here, right to Prime.

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:17.100
Um, so.

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:20.610
So, actually, these charts are kiddwaya.

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:29.100
It's actually it's just like nothing like, it's just a while so we can redraw it in this manner.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:43.530
Just like this and like this, so it's back, I'll draw it so that we can see a better view and not in order to solve it for too. So, in this manner, we can see.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:47.910
We are given in a question of 6,000,000.

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:54.690
Uh, it is split current is and some current at the current we will move here.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:51:54.690 --> 00:52:02.700
So, can I ask you what is the best technique to find I, to Prime.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.060
What is the best technique to find out to Brian?

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:14.400
Currently wider yes currently wider because I have to Prime.

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:23.130
Look at this, uh, which is 6 divided by 6+12.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:27.120
And multiply by the original.

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.480
6.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.530
So that you will get tied to Prime.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.020
So you will get, let's let me do it here.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:48.060
Uh, that's the 1 that's, uh, 1 in 1 pitch in 1 pitch.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:52:48.060 --> 00:53:01.920
So, we, this is the next 1, are we focused on nevermind? We, that's the, the next 1.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.120
So, we now get a I, to Prime.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:13.950
Okay, so the next, uh, the next step is.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:19.530
To focus on the sauce and removing the current source.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:23.790
So removing the current sauce, you must know the theory which states.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:29.040
Removing that current sauce replacing with, uh, both, uh, awkward.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.430
So, when you can see here opens the.

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:39.150
Actually, this is, uh, irrelevant. It's just like a wire.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:42.570
Nothing is not relevant, so at the end.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:47.430
You have, uh, only this.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.620
The only this, because it's, um.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:59.310
This is just a, uh, open secret wire. So when you have only this, you can.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:05.400
Rearrange it so this is, is here and why not? Um.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.420
Drawing because still 6 and 12, and at the bottom.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.320
14 and 35 kilohertz and.

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:19.530
Also for the wisdom in 1 hours time.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:24.930
Oh, well, I was you should also observe.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:28.890
That, uh, if this is 9 volts.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:33.360
If this is 9 books.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.740
And this to emperor, this vast bill.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:46.380
9 books as well, and this 1 is in parallel to that. This also must be 9 books.

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.250
So, we learn divide the theory. I give tips.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:54.420
Coming in the, uh, with them, and also.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:58.770
Voltage in federal they are the same yes.

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:14.580
You see, um.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:21.120
Uh, the chefs current law to get high to double point.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:27.960
You want to use in which area? Uh, in which.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.940
Okay, uh, like a Mish mash, right?

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:42.660
This is 1:1:message. Yes, you can see.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:50.310
Yes, I can use it. Yes.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:56.760
Okay, so now we, we, but I just want to highlight if this is 9 volts.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:01.920
This also must be 9 works. This must be 9 books as well.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:10.830
Just to revise that theory that will come in the midterm, uh, in 1 and half hours time.

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:16.920
So so if we.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:25.920
We throw it in this manner, but actually it's up to the students, but to make it, uh, better view. So I draw it.

458 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:32.340
In this manner lab, this this vendor is top and bottom.

459 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.400
But, uh, this vendor is.

460 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:43.200
Go with this manner of drawing is, uh, left and right but they are the same, right?

461 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:49.080
Yeah, the same just to whichever 1 is convenient. So I redraw it.

462 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:54.240
I regret it, uh, in terms of.

463 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.520
Left and right but there are still 9 votes and 9 volts in.

464 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.050
And so the i2 Prime is here.

465 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:08.820
So, can I ask you this time? Uh, I, to.

466 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:13.980
He's using a current divider rule or.

467 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.280
A voltage divide to.

468 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:30.240
I too, I to Frank, I too is also is voltage.

469 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:35.940
Because, um, I say, so we have to be calm and.

470 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.290
There is 9 goals right? Change color.

471 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:48.360
This means this also is.

472 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:56.340
Change color this means.

473 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:01.410
These 2 point is 9 months. So if this is 9 volts.

474 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:08.610
And we know 600 kilowatts and Turkey, or what will be high to plan.

475 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:14.580
What will be I to prime if we know that this is 9 volts 9 books here.

476 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:20.160
So, you, uh, let's try it.

477 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:30.480
So, it's a practice for because the now will also be asked in the midterm questions questions.

478 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:45.510
The questions so will be asked, um.

479 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:54.330
Resistors in parallel will not not will be asked as a single, but in a 2nd, so you need to you to know. Okay. This 1. S.

480 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:58:54.330 --> 00:59:00.900
This is in parallel this 1, uh, oh, because they are in parallel the voltage must be like this.

481 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.410
This 1, you've got a divider slopped.

482 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:08.520
This is also a good question for the victim.

483 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.140
What a victim exams that presents.

484 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.070
So you got the right answer, which is 9 volts.

485 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:24.330
Divided by that branch 6 and 12 6+12. So I to.

486 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:27.810
Is, uh.

487 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:31.260
The Prime is 0.5.

488 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:41.970
Billy 0.5Million this now, I did the steps for the previous 1.

489 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.200
I already did the steps, but let's, um.

490 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.950
Let's explain again now we focus.

491 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:53.460
On the 6Million current source and we remove.

492 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.840
No, 9 will be.

493 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.540
We draw it like this and you already mentioned rightly just now.

494 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:09.180
I to Prime is using the current divider.

495 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:16.020
So, let's, uh, let's answer I to Prime, in terms of current divider.

496 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.100
Theory, so I, I took time.

497 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:24.090
Uh, in terms of current divided theory.

498 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:29.040
And, uh, you can see here, please select the the correct answer.

499 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:48.000
So, I, to prime to Prime, using the current divided.

500 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.360
And from the what Super position superposition means, we.

501 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:00.630
We act the final I to is I to Brian.

502 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:04.500
And I, to double point 0.5.

503 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.530
Uh, last.

504 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:19.830
To really for the prime, so in total our final answer is 2.5Million. Yes.

505 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.860
So that is, uh, that.

506 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:28.770
The technique of Super position Kyoto support position.

507 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:43.590
Okay, so if there is no question.

508 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:49.590
So, I would like to proceed with, uh.

509 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:54.090
So, let's see the answer. 1st. Mm. Hmm.

510 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:01:54.090 --> 01:02:00.330
That's good. And so we have learned superposition, but now.

511 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:03.540
We are going to learn, uh.

512 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:12.930
The most interesting and permits the reduction of complex networks to a simple form for analysis and design.

513 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:21.450
So, because, uh, it's parallel, it's easy.

514 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.930
But if it's a combination too much.

515 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:28.830
Too many combinations, so it's better.

516 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:35.220
To to have a technique and this technique is called.

517 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:44.640
Okay, so let's see. So, what we want to do is, uh, all the complexities.

518 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.540
Um, for example, we have, uh, what.

519 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:54.600
And then all these here.

520 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.550
And then here many things.

521 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:04.830
And then some here and so forth. So we want to.

522 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:08.880
Uh, do view some voltage across the.

523 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:15.420
Certain places, so we want to simplify all of them.

524 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.900
And this is called.

525 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:24.600
And.

526 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.240
And here, we can look at the same point and find whatever that we want.

527 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:39.330
So that is, uh, it's like simplification 1st year we might have, uh.

528 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:44.460
Uh, this 1, this 1 another here.

529 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:50.790
So this needs to simplify all the current work, all the sauce into 1.

530 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:54.750
To simplify all the resistance into 1.

531 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:58.530
E, uh, 8, 70 and.

532 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:02.370
Resistance and then we can.

533 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:07.530
To whatever, uh, easily to find, for example, voltage.

534 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:11.580
Across a, and B, and so forth.

535 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.680
So, we want our objective here. You can see here.

536 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:23.670
This is voltage source current source. Resistor 1. resistor 2.

537 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:28.800
And this blue box, we want to.

538 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:41.160
Summarize them to become just, uh, 1, uh, 1 voltage, which call it voltage 70 and 1 resistance. We call it resistance Stephanie.

539 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.860
And then it's easy to solve or whatever that we want for the.

540 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.010
For the across, uh, a, and B.

541 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.640
Be the point a, and B, okay.

542 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:05.370
So, remove that portion of the network where the is found.

543 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:11.880
Uh, this requires that the load resist our L. we temporarily remove from a network.

544 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.900
But the terminals of the remaining 2 terminal network.

545 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:22.350
So then we calculate, uh, R, W.

546 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:29.340
By setting all sources to 0, what data sources are replaced by.

547 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.790
And the current sources, my open tickets.

548 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:39.150
And then finding the result of resistance between the 2 terminals.

549 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:47.220
If the internal resistance of the voltage, and our current process is included in the original network, it must remain.

550 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:54.690
When the sauces are set to 0, and then calculate.

551 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:05:54.690 --> 01:06:00.240
By returning all success to their original position and finding the open. 2nd.

552 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:09.570
Voltage between the mock terminals so I think, um, and lastly a 2nd.

553 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:17.280
The portion of the separate previously remove replace between the terminals on the equivalent setups.

554 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.440
But it's better to to use an example. So I will.

555 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:27.210
I will do 1 simple example and then.

556 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:32.070
Uh, develop from that from that. So here we are.

557 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:38.250
Uh, we have look, we are loads, we should not.

558 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:43.470
We in the blue box, uh, how the load is removed.

559 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:49.950
And then open 2nd is far. So the 1st step is to remove.

560 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:06:49.950 --> 01:07:01.620
Uh, the load to get to use the, we remove, uh, the R. L. so we, when we remove the loads.

561 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.100
This will be an open 2nd.

562 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:09.090
This will be a positive, but we should not.

563 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:12.780
We should be wary. We should.

564 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:18.510
No, where is AB, AB is still here it is still here.

565 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:23.040
All right, so that is the 1st step to remove the load.

566 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.370
We have to remove that we have removed the load.

567 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:36.570
So, to obtain, so, at the end bear in mind that we weren't.

568 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:45.270
Uh, what page? 17, and we want.

569 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.660
So.

570 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:53.010
After we removed the lotus now the 1st step.

571 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:58.230
The next step is to find the so.

572 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:07:58.230 --> 01:08:06.180
The next step is, uh, all voltages will be shorter.

573 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:12.930
And all of our all current process will be open. 2nd.

574 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:17.190
So, remember, the load is still remove the R. L. is no more there.

575 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:21.270
Now, we remove the voltage source.

576 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:25.260
And we replace with, uh.

577 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.440
Why are you? So.

578 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.890
There is no current source here, so just a voltage sauce.

579 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:36.780
So, we replaced with, uh, shops in so now.

580 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:45.360
In mind N. D because a, and B is the point of view the eye you can see that. I.

581 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.590
I view of the our.

582 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:56.400
Resistance 17, so if we view from here.

583 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:06.720
So, I like you, you might do not want to withdraw, but I'd like to redraw it. So have a better view. So I'll read through it in this manner.

584 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.190
Because this is just a wire, so I put it.

585 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:14.220
Uh, 1, 2.

586 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.900
And, and we still here and the, I view.

587 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:25.530
Of the, so if we view, uh, our eye from here.

588 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:30.960
What we can see is are 1 and half to.

589 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.790
In parallel, right? How do I get up to add in parallel.

590 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.880
Therefore, we can.

591 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.000
As the point of view is like, looking at.

592 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.650
As a result then it is.

593 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:54.480
What we call as a total from here is a by.

594 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.060
Up to add 1 last half 2 because.

595 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.620
You see the special formula for 2 resistors in parallel.

596 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:10.260
And again, I emphasize special formula or 2 reasons this internal we'll come up in the.

597 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:18.000
Victim exam in 1 hour 1 hour time. Okay.

598 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.990
So, if this is, uh, 3 and 6, this is 3 hours.

599 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:28.410
And this is 6 months so I think.

600 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:32.310
Uh, you you know how to find.

601 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:37.800
This too as a result. So now you, you have solved.

602 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.530
Uh, you have now, uh, update the value.

603 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:48.630
Of our This is.

604 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:53.160
So, now we, we are going to, uh, find.

605 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:59.370
Uh, both or 8:30:so has been found.

606 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:03.960
The next step is to find 8:7:or re, voltage 17.

607 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.040
So, to find a work test, you.

608 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:15.870
You put back all the boxes sources, because previously, when you want to find the resistor.

609 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.530
We remove all the voltage and current sources.

610 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:28.320
But now we want to find the we, we put back all the voltage sources.

611 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.570
Um, uh, but still, there are a note.

612 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:43.380
It's not yet. It's not yet. It's not yet, uh, return. We just, uh, put back the work of sauce.

613 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:53.010
So when we put back the voltage source here, we got 3 orbs and 6. M. but that's why it's very important.

614 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:57.780
To not lose track of a and B.

615 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:04.080
Because that is our, I view, oh, I view a point of view.

616 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.410
Now, this point of view.

617 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:12.450
Between is the voltage.

618 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:23.400
It is is both stage, right? The voltage across this because this is the point of view.

619 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.500
And as usual, I like to draw it redraw it.

620 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:34.260
So this is not volts. Uh, this is 3.

621 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.550
The quotes and this is 6 hours and, uh.

622 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:43.200
The point of view, the view is between a, and B.

623 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.440
And to get the R, the.

624 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.210
And also the work is divider theory.

625 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:12:51.210 --> 01:13:02.850
Is this 1, but you are going to experience it in the victim the voltage divide the theory the voltage divided theory. So I hope you just now, you are.

626 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:06.210
You finish successfully mention.

627 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:09.750
The current divider theory and I, will you still.

628 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:14.550
Uh, you are well versed in both this divided query if we have 6.

629 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:20.490
Those 3 ops here at 9 volts, the voltage divided theory states that are voltage.

630 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:24.690
Plus is 6.

631 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:29.820
Divided by 6+3xby 9 books.

632 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.030
So, now we have update.

633 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:38.250
Uh, previously we have to obtain.

634 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:46.740
Our so last, but not least we re, draw it as a final answer.

635 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:52.560
The is 6 books. Our revenue is 2.

636 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.730
And now we put back our load.

637 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:59.970
Please look back in a 2nd.

638 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:04.860
And when we place the note back in a 2nd.

639 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.700
We can easily find the current.

640 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.790
The color flowing in the.

641 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:15.630
Uh, load resistance, because I hope.

642 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:18.900
You are well versed by now that current is.

643 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.530
Well, it's folks logged voltage.

644 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:26.520
Over over the resistance.

645 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.640
Okay, so maybe the question will say, okay, now the R. L. is 1.

646 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.420
Let's let's see, let's say.

647 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:44.340
So I am, is a 6 volts divided by the total.

648 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.110
Resistance 2 and 3 2+3 and 5.

649 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:53.490
This is just example. So R. L. can be any value.

650 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:56.520
But it's not easy to solve.

651 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.390
Or the so just observed. Yeah.

652 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:06.510
I think is our original question so we were asked to find.

653 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:15.000
I L, if you were asked to find, I am, it's going to be.

654 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.320
Maybe we can solve it, but.

655 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.980
Uh, is this is maybe a bit complicated.

656 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:29.280
But, in other cases, with more, uh, combination of currents source, voltage source.

657 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.950
Resistance in hybrid, serious parallel so it's going to be.

658 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:44.250
Uh, difficult so the covenant theory, makes it, like, summarize all of the elements in the blue box.

659 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:50.940
To become, uh, or voltage 17.

660 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:55.920
Uh, and and and therefore you can solve.

661 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:04.890
Whatever is required, because it's just a simple slow in this case.

662 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:11.970
So, now we have another example, and this is, is the.

663 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:17.280
And the blue box, we have the 12 current sauce.

664 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.780
Bones and 2 offs so.

665 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:27.300
We are going to use the.

666 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:32.370
So 1st of all, uh, we are.

667 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:35.490
The answer is 6 months for the.

668 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:41.370
Um, because find out that we need, we.

669 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:48.720
We replaced, of course, the load is no more there. So the load is not part of the analysis.

670 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:56.160
Okay to find the afternoon we then replace the current source with and.

671 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:03.930
Okay, 3rd, this current source is open secure. Of course, the, the are load is no matter, but.

672 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:09.870
Bear in mind, where are the points? Where are the point? A, and point B.

673 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:14.820
Does this is, uh, I view that we want to.

674 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:19.830
Look at my view that you want to look at.

675 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:30.960
So, and so this is becoming open 2nd.

676 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.890
So this means, I can I ask you.

677 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:40.260
Uh, because some of you will say, why is it not for us.

678 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:44.910
Why is it not for us? Because I'm looking like this.

679 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:49.620
But you have to look from the point of view from a.

680 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:58.410
Between a, and P, so if you look from here, so that's why I like to redraw it if it.

681 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:05.040
To avoid plus, this can be.

682 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:11.160
Be drawn are the 2 OEMs.

683 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.550
And for us, so we have to.

684 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.610
To be safe, keep track of.

685 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.180
A, and B, or you can draw it up.

686 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:27.330
If I rewrote it, and if I look, uh, if I look from.

687 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:32.640
I see that the resistor that I see from a is.

688 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:39.870
To register in series, 2 and 4 2+4 is 6 hours. So we have solved.

689 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:43.200
Uh, that would so if you are.

690 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.590
Just remind me remind me.

691 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:50.520
To find we.

692 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.600
Retain back we return back the.

693 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:00.150
Removed previously, it was removed now 117 with.

694 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:06.090
Put back the current sauce and but the other loads is still.

695 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:09.900
It's still removed, it's still removed.

696 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:16.770
Um, but now the point a is still maintain, and we look.

697 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:22.950
From here. Okay. And this is something interesting.

698 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:28.560
Something interesting here, because let's do it. Uh, let's do.

699 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.540
Uh, our, uh, redrawing it, uh, let me rejoin.

700 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:47.070
Yeah, and this is the point, right? The point.

701 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:53.490
Uh, AV, something interesting.

702 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:58.980
I hope you see that the carbon.

703 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:05.640
The problem is moving here this is.

704 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.120
Hanging right as if there's no use.

705 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.390
Because no current, this is open.

706 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:20.100
Here is, here is like, is hanging, so this resistor is of not relevance.

707 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.200
Right. It's not relevant so as if, uh, it's nothing.

708 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.860
The resistor does not exist, so it's.

709 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:35.310
Uh, just like this, or even if you want, you can just say.

710 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:39.330
It's nothing so now we.

711 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:45.930
The point of view of a B, is these 2 points.

712 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:51.060
So we want to find 8:17:or we want to find the voltage.

713 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.680
8 Avenue or the voltage.

714 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.870
By looking from a and B.

715 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:05.760
And I think, uh, you, um.

716 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.780
The whole pitch between a, and B.

717 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.050
And this is 12.

718 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:21.960
And this is phones.

719 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.660
And, uh, soft transformation.

720 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:32.070
Let me remember whether it's in the midterm exam.

721 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:39.630
Soft transformation. No. So now, since you are here, I give you the tips.

722 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:47.910
What in the midterm exam is a resistance in parallel, uh, current divider, uh, nodal analysis. So.

723 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:51.570
You there is no.

724 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:56.430
Transformation question, but here in here.

725 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:21:56.430 --> 01:22:03.480
We can observe that this can be transformed 12 times for.

726 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.580
Is, uh, 48 transformation.

727 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:13.800
And in series is for forms.

728 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.310
And do not forget always the.

729 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:27.000
Between the point a, and we and we want the E voltage.

730 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.170
So, the voltage, uh, looking at this is 48 volts.

731 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:40.530
Is 48 volts so the, the voltage across between 8.

732 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:50.580
Is 48 volts so, this means 8 is 48 books uh, is 6 hours.

733 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:55.230
And, uh, our 3 or our loads.

734 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:22:55.230 --> 01:23:01.680
Our load is 7 months so the last, only at the last moment.

735 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.070
That the 7 Ops will be.

736 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:08.370
We will be put back in the 2nd.

737 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:14.520
Okay, so now it's easy because whatever you want to find.

738 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:20.430
Uh, is it the current going through the 3 now? It's easy.

739 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:24.000
To file because everything is.

740 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.390
In terms of and the, so you can.

741 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:35.700
Let's see what the time I, it's, uh, onslaught the voltage divided by the total resistance.

742 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:42.300
So that is we have learned so far is, uh, support position.

743 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.170
This morning and 17.

744 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:51.090
That would mean Kingdom, so another.

745 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:56.640
Interesting example, is the load there are node can be.

746 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.880
That'd be a new app.

747 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.120
In this case, um.

748 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.880
So, in this case, uh, the upload.

749 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.680
Is between this R4 resistance?

750 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:31.440
Sometimes most, like, sometimes in here or here, but if the question mentioned this, this means this is the R low.

751 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.760
So, it's very, um, complicated.

752 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.930
Because this is the voltage or the.

753 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:44.040
Anything that we want to do, because it's not somewhere else. So we are going to use.

754 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.490
Uh, Evelyn.

755 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:54.180
To summarize it to summarize to have only 1.

756 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:59.280
Uh, 1.

757 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.310
1 resistance.

758 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:06.270
And between a, and B.

759 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:10.260
So, where do we have this summarization.

760 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.390
It's easy to find, uh, the color cause it's just, uh.

761 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:21.630
All slow. Okay so the 1st step.

762 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:27.150
Is to find so this is our load so I will not.

763 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:31.710
Between this point a, and we will be removed.

764 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:41.460
All in the analysis, except put back in the last, uh, steps as you remember in the last step then only we put back the outer loop.

765 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:46.560
So, to find the afternoon, if you remember, we will.

766 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:54.900
Uh, remove both data source and replace with a short.

767 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:25:54.900 --> 01:26:00.600
So, keep track of a, and B, always.

768 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:07.080
Because that is our point of view I look to the left or loop the director from the left, or right.

769 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.260
From the point of view, and here we can see the voltage sauce has been.

770 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:18.450
Remove and replace with, uh, short circuit straight wire.

771 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:23.850
1, now, um, it's better to.

772 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:27.210
We throw it and make.

773 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:30.450
Uh, this to the last.

774 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:42.060
Plus it's all in parallel so whether you make a and B on the left or on here, no doesn't matter. So we make a.

775 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:48.870
To add the 6 on here at the 6. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

776 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:56.010
And again, there is something interesting, uh, something.

777 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:26:56.010 --> 01:27:02.640
Interesting here there are 2 methods. So here.

778 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.250
This is a 0 cost.

779 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:14.400
Is 0 homes right? And this is 2 homes, but as a whole.

780 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.500
These 2 are in parallel back.

781 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:29.220
These 2 in parallel so you use the spectrum formula for to resistance in parallel 0 multiplied by 2 0.

782 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:33.480
And 0+2 and of course 0.

783 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.170
0, 0.

784 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:41.250
So 0, so this 2.

785 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:50.850
Uh, these 2 is just, uh, this to overall is just a short circuit wire of.

786 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:55.650
So this is the homes.

787 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:27:55.650 --> 01:28:06.000
And this is our, um, cause we have, we brought it here. So, um.

788 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.460
This, uh, this, this is 6 hours.

789 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:19.320
And this is our point of view, uh, a, and B.

790 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:24.090
But, of course, uh, we probably need is better because.

791 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:28.170
What s, W why not draw it here?

792 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:33.480
Why not, uh, drawing here so we can have a better view.

793 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:43.200
Okay, so what I did is step by step here is zeros and 2 offs in parallel.

794 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:49.590
If you were at 2:00:00, always just a strict wire.

795 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:53.550
And 4 hours is here. So why not throw it like this?

796 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:57.390
And our point of view is here.

797 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:28:57.390 --> 01:29:07.440
And this point of view, when we look at this, we are looking at, uh, 6 and 4 in parallel. So we do another.

798 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.840
Resistors in parallel 6 multiplied by for.

799 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.370
6+4 in order.

800 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:22.650
We got to get our.

801 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.490
Um, W, our our.

802 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:35.730
Okay, in order to get our our mm, hmm.

803 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:46.290
So, we have obtained, uh, W, we have to obtain the now, our next task is to part the.

804 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:51.540
The E. W. so if it means.

805 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.900
We, uh, we are.

806 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:02.010
The is still there with no, our load. The armor is still a removed.

807 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:05.700
1st, the is the point of view.

808 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:09.750
And since we want to find, we put back.

809 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:13.200
We'll take sauce now.

810 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.230
If we have a look.

811 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:24.270
From this point of view, um.

812 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:29.130
So, it is better to, uh, to draw it.

813 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:35.130
Okay, so, at this point of view.

814 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.220
So, I will do it, uh, from here to here.

815 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.840
And here I redraw it.

816 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:57.840
Close 6 hours.

817 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:03.360
For all 6 books and remember see the a.

818 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.190
Is here and the is here so therefore.

819 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:13.950
The a, uh, is here.

820 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:18.240
And the B, so this is a.

821 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.870
The is here and this point of view.

822 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:25.200
And so this is.

823 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.030
It votes in the opposite priority.

824 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:33.150
And we don't care so much about.

825 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:33.150 --> 01:31:39.360
But the rest, but about is too old, because we are carrying more about.

826 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.020
The part of you between a, and B.

827 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:47.130
So, we can see that again.

828 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:53.220
Uh, in parallel parallel theory that you are willing to experience.

829 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:59.489
Uh, in 1, August time, so this is it goes, right?

830 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:31:59.489 --> 01:32:05.879
This is 8 books. Okay this is at volts.

831 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:05.879 --> 01:32:10.109
This must be 8 volts.

832 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:13.199
So this is this 8 volts.

833 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:19.289
So, I hope you can see that. This is a voltage divider room.

834 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:24.239
To get the voltage across this 6. Oh register.

835 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:29.609
And that will be your E governance that will be your E. W.

836 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:29.609 --> 01:32:33.269
Okay, so.

837 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:33.269 --> 01:32:36.389
At the end.

838 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:36.389 --> 01:32:41.249
We find our we find our resist.

839 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:41.249 --> 01:32:52.559
And the will be the load visitor out for will be placed back in the circuit in the, in the 2nd.

840 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:32:52.559 --> 01:33:01.109
Will be placed by in the 2nd, so this challenge example I will not, uh, I will not.

841 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:04.409
Um, um.

842 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:04.409 --> 01:33:08.219
I will not go through this is.

843 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:08.219 --> 01:33:12.329
For your for your analysis at home.

844 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:12.329 --> 01:33:16.259
Okay, so I will, this is another example of.

845 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:16.259 --> 01:33:20.789
Uh, E, and.

846 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:24.389
But, um, you go through.

847 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:24.389 --> 01:33:29.159
But is good practice for your midterm exam in 30 minutes.

848 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:29.159 --> 01:33:33.599
So, I will, you don't need to analyze this.

849 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:33.599 --> 01:33:41.429
But I want you to, uh, to, to, to tell me.

850 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:41.429 --> 01:33:49.109
What is so what is our 3.

851 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:52.769
In parallel to to.

852 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:52.769 --> 01:33:59.549
See, what is in parallel to to.

853 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:33:59.549 --> 01:34:07.859
What is in parallel to? We have our 3.

854 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:07.859 --> 01:34:12.269
And he's out 2 so what is our total.

855 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:16.019 --> 01:34:25.559
Um, which juries are using, which theory should use if 2 registers in parallel.

856 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:25.559 --> 01:34:33.389
To resistance in parallel how 1, uh, that 1 is the long formula.

857 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:33.389 --> 01:34:38.909
What is this? Okay.

858 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:38.909 --> 01:34:43.199
That's good. So with so if we know our.

859 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:46.919
2 is.

860 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:46.919 --> 01:34:50.639
So, let's fine. Um.

861 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:50.639 --> 01:34:55.919
Uh, are 3 in parallel to have to.

862 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:34:55.919 --> 01:35:14.309
3, uh.

863 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:17.879
All 3 mean, the.

864 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:17.879 --> 01:35:23.099
I don't go to detail the steps because going to book, but I just want to.

865 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:23.099 --> 01:35:29.459
Practice with you, uh, our 3 in parallel to have to.

866 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:29.459 --> 01:35:34.589
All right, so our 3 in parallel to 2.

867 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:34.589 --> 01:35:38.309
And is 2.4kilohertz.

868 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:38.309 --> 01:35:42.359
So, if as a whole is 2 point.

869 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:42.359 --> 01:35:48.359
For so these 2.

870 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:48.359 --> 01:35:51.389
Will be in parallel to.

871 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:51.389 --> 01:35:55.739
So, these 2 to reduce the internal.

872 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:55.739 --> 01:35:58.949
Okay, um, yes, please.

873 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:35:58.949 --> 01:36:03.959
Can I ask you so now you have found 3.

874 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:07.319
The lady the lady.

875 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:07.319 --> 01:36:14.999
So, now, I have you have sent, uh, are 3 in parallel to add 2 is the special formula, right?

876 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:14.999 --> 01:36:19.709
Okay, now we have found it S2.4 kilohertz.

877 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:22.949
So, these 2.4kilohertz.

878 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:22.949 --> 01:36:27.269
Uh, in parallel to so what is.

879 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:27.269 --> 01:36:32.819
As a formula, what do you apply?

880 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:32.819 --> 01:36:37.319
Then the same, so, what, uh, what is the value.

881 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:45.209 --> 01:36:49.199
No, it's not. The question is not said yeah, so what's the value.

882 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:36:55.349 --> 01:37:03.539
What what's I wonder you and then.

883 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:03.539 --> 01:37:08.069
Okay, that's.

884 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:08.069 --> 01:37:12.629
That's a good answer. So this, uh.

885 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:16.229
Select the, the, for the next question.

886 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:19.829 --> 01:37:34.379
The next question.

887 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:34.379 --> 01:37:42.119
In we have found the answer, but it's also in parallel to.

888 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:42.119 --> 01:37:47.069
Add 1, so.

889 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:47.069 --> 01:37:51.029
That is the answer 0.6kilowatts.

890 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:51.029 --> 01:37:55.949
So, but a full analysis, uh, you can do it at home.

891 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:37:55.949 --> 01:38:00.929
And I'm not go into the, uh, detail for a full analysis.

892 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:00.929 --> 01:38:09.089
So the answer just now is 0.6kilograms.

893 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:09.089 --> 01:38:12.119
So, we have learned, um.

894 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:15.779
We have learned, uh.

895 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:15.779 --> 01:38:20.729
17 is.

896 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:27.869
This and the, and resistance.

897 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:27.869 --> 01:38:32.999
And that the point between the points.

898 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:32.999 --> 01:38:37.379
And that is the, the road.

899 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:37.379 --> 01:38:45.539
There are the resistance, so this is, uh.

900 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:45.539 --> 01:38:48.569
Uh, the okay.

901 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:48.569 --> 01:38:53.789
But, uh, we can also.

902 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:53.789 --> 01:38:56.969
Uh, what we call a knock knock then.

903 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:38:56.969 --> 01:39:01.889
Equivalent Euro, not term instead of the voltage.

904 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:01.889 --> 01:39:08.519
17 and resistor February in series. Uh, it is our M, the objective is.

905 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:08.519 --> 01:39:12.239
The current source and the resistance.

906 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:18.389
Uh, in parallel, so there are symbol and we've not done. I end.

907 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:18.389 --> 01:39:26.159
And R. M. okay. So 1 way is to.

908 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:30.149
To find, uh, and.

909 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:35.189
If the questions say, find the doctor for a 2nd, you can just.

910 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:38.939
You can just convert it once you've got.

911 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:42.269
Uh, and.

912 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:42.269 --> 01:39:46.439
You can forward to I am not done.

913 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:50.219
And our resistance Norton.

914 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:50.219 --> 01:39:55.199
Observe that the resistor long term is equals to.

915 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:39:55.199 --> 01:40:00.209
The value to resist the right.

916 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:00.209 --> 01:40:07.409
So, we, uh, today we have covered support position and governing equivalent citizens.

917 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:07.409 --> 01:40:11.369
So, hopefully, uh.

918 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:11.369 --> 01:40:16.469
We have also revision. Yes. Now, uh, for current.

919 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:21.359
This is in parallel voltage divider set up and so forth.

920 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:21.359 --> 01:40:26.279
So, I will take a few minutes breaks and I will give.

921 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:26.279 --> 01:40:29.729
Total analysis revision because.

922 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (3159643136)
01:40:29.729 --> 01:40:34.824
You request, uh, no, the analysis so.
