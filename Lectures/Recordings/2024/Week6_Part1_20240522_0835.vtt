1 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.200
Hey everyone, you'll have a good.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.040
Good morning and here we are going to.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.460
Cover lecture six, basically.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.030
Capacitors and capacities, so.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.090
The application for capacitors, the, the best application is your mobile phone battery.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.350
Or your laptop battery, your tablet battery.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.710
So in the, if you are not charging.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.700
The battery will hold energy.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360
And the battery.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.980
In your mobile phone or your laptop, is.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.600
Consisting of capacitors are consisting of capacitors.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.930
So we are going to learn how other.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.970
How is the charging, discharging of your battery or your capacitors?

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750
And, and.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.350
And other details so the symbol.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.350
So this is the symbol for capacitors.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.430
Two straight lines, two straight lines.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.880
And two straight lines.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:59.400
So do not be, it's different from a voltage supply. Voltage supply is this one and the capacitor symbol is.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:09.690
Two, two equals straight lines. So before we go into capacitors, let's.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.430
Let us learn the theory or the underlying principle behind.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.720
The capacitors and in general.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.000
Electric flux lines extend from a positively charged body.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.460
To a negatively charged body. So if you have a positive charge, a negative charge.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.260
The electric, this is called electric flux lines. It will.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.330
It will originate or it will start from a positively.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.670
A positive charge towards the negative charge, so that's the arrows.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.280
Okay, so that if we have two positive charges closed together so.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.030
They will repel in this manner.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.540
So, this is the.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.660
Some formulas.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.670
So if we have positive charge, so the electric flux line will.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.370
We'll go outs outwards. So if we have a negative charge.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.110
The electric large lines will go inwards towards it.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.849
It was it. So here we have some.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.209
Some.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:41.519
Formulas, which is A is area, and this is flux and this is electric field.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:44.999
Density. So I will.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:51.029
And here we have some electric field is forced newton's perculum.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:56.549
And, so these are some of the basic formulas.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:04:56.549 --> 00:05:02.909
And, if we have a capacitor, as I mentioned.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.949
Expressor is the symbol is two equally straight lines closed together.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.019
So what is the capacitors doing? In between there is an air gap.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.099
So the capacitor is two, two.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.079
Oh, actually two parallel plates if we draw it into the three D.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:25.769
Two parallel plates and in between.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:34.019
There are air gaps. They are just air in between the two plates, the court two conducting plates.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.039
So when we have a capacitor, the electron.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.609
Or the current will flow.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:45.029
And then the electric field.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.019
I will accommodate the positive charge?

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:54.269
We'll accumulate on one of the plates and the negative charge.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:57.959
We'll accumulate on the other plate because.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.469
This is the positive from the.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.419
Voltage sauce, and this is the negative, so the negative charge will accommodate.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.329
At the bottom plate and the positive charges will accumulate at the.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:16.499
Toplates. So when they're positive and negative?

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:22.559
So the electric flux electric flux line will s.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:27.629
Originate from the positive charge towards the negative charge.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.709
Therefore, the current and still flow.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:35.459
Because of this electric flux line.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:41.819
In between the two parallel plates. So this means if we have two.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:47.339
Put three dimensional if I draw it.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.929
So we, this is called capacitor, the capacitor and.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:06:51.929 --> 00:07:01.169
So an electric field, the blue arrows is set up between the two peril plates. So capacitons.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:07.379
It's a measure of a capacitor's ability to store it to store charge on its plates?

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:12.059
So that's why you have a mobile phone battery?

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:15.989
Or laptop battery.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:19.019
Is the ability of the battery to store?

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:23.669
To Store the charge so that you can use the battery.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.179
A laptop battery or mobile phone battery?

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:30.989
To to use the charge.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:34.439
For your application. And.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.159
Sorry. So the.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.899
The capacitons is given by the symbol C.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:48.179
The capacitor's value is the charge over the votes.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:53.849
The columns per votes, Q OVERV where Q is.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.959
The charge in columns and V is the voltage.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:04.409
Between the two plates be in between the two plates. So this formula is.

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.769
Is given in the appendix in the appendix?

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:13.019
I think you have seen the appendix during your midterm and this is one of the formula.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:19.079
Given in the appendix for your midterm and it also will also be given.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:25.649
In the appendix or the formula sheet for the final exam.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:30.269
So in the 1st quiz return quiz.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:35.909
Measure the resistance, the resistance, if you still remember is.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.679
Row L are over A.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.659
That is to measure if we have a resistance.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:54.419
A resistor in the laboratory, so we want to know how many or how many oms.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:58.409
So we, it depends on the material.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:03.629
And the length, and the cross functional area. So similarly.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.629
Or if we have two parallel plates?

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:14.759
If we have two plates, we want to know what is the strength of the capacitant's value.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:19.589
Is it, if we have a small.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.129
Small plates or if we have.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:27.869
A larger, larger place what will be the relationship?

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:32.249
In order to produce the capacity, the capacitance value.

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:37.109
So we can see that, to measure.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:41.939
The capacitance, it depends on the.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:45.329
Exelong is a primitivity and it is.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:50.159
Fix and it is, four, five.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:55.769
Times ten to the minus seven, it is fixed provided in the appendix of formula sheet.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:00.599
And the area is, this area?

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:05.579
The area of the plate?

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:10.259
In this area and the D is the.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:13.529
The separation, the gaps between.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:19.469
The between the two parallel plates, between the two parallel plates.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:19.469 --> 00:10:22.829
So actually the Epsilon is a general term.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:27.539
Absolon is always equal to absolute north.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:32.579
Excellent arm, and excellent arm is always.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:37.619
A fixed at fixed number four by times.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:42.179
I'm sorry I I confused with a new note.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:48.359
So I will say it's not 4.7 it is eight point.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:51.359
Eight five times.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:55.949
At time to the minus twelve, but don't worry, these values.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:59.309
Are provided in the appendix.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:02.729
And this absternal RR means a relative.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:06.629
R means are relative. This means.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:10.709
This excellent out depends on the material.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:13.709
Perhaps maybe.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:19.739
A glass, perhaps.

121 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:27.509
What the crystal or personin, so each different material will have.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:33.539
A different, different accident R value. So this will also provide this.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:37.229
Each, there is some table of different materials.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:44.999
And, we'll, they will provide, they will have a different excellent R value, so you also do not need to.

125 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:52.589
Memorize? So excellent R will be provided usually provided in the question.

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:02.039
So as an example, if we have.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:06.989
This is our, this is our capacitors.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:06.989 --> 00:12:10.739
And let's say the area is air.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:14.759
And the gaps is D And we found that.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:19.559
The faster is five microphone.

131 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:23.969
So what happened if we have.

132 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:27.209
The area instead of A.

133 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:30.869
It's 3A3 times, three times larger?

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:34.559
But the, the gap between the two.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:38.009
Let's are still, still the same.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:46.739
So how can we, what do you think will be the the new value of the capacits?

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:52.019
Three times. So instead, because here the formula is.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:56.249
C equals to excellent not excellent R A.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:59.639
Divided by D So since the area is.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:05.399
A3A, therefore multiply by three.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:09.119
There is a denumerator, so this will be 15.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:12.269
Microforups, microforups.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:16.229
Sorry. Okay.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:26.069
And so we can, we can do a few more examples. E.g., this one, if this is.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:31.379
An area and then the gap is D, but what happened if.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:36.809
The same area but the gap is increased to two D.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:43.379
What will, what do you think will be the new seat?

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:46.979
Cause now D becomes two D.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:51.119
So overall, this will become 0.1.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:58.439
Divided by two becomes zero point and zero five microfiles.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:13:58.439 --> 00:14:02.489
And for part C in this example.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:07.139
Everything is the same, area is the same.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:11.279
The gap is the same but now we change the material.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:19.529
So the material is excellent not, an excellent arm. The material is excellent arm.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:23.999
So this one, this one, but.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:29.009
Is the gap is in between its air, but in this one.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:29.009 --> 00:14:33.029
But the gap is in the gap is not there, but.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:38.189
Some paraphine paper and paraphine paper has.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:43.439
Absent R of 2.5. But before that, I would like to ask you.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:48.449
What do you think is the excellent R for ann?

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:48.449 --> 00:14:53.309
If this just don't need to memorize, but do you do you know?

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:58.739
Yes, it's one. Okay, so excellent R is one for air because that's the.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:02.309
Reference or visit and therefore.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:05.669
Now it's NO more air, it's for the fine paper.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:11.339
So this, this becomes instead of 1 h.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:15.269
It becomes 2.5 excellent R.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:18.629
Before I think you agree that.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:21.749
The value of C is when.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:21.749 --> 00:15:25.829
20 multiplied by 2.5.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:32.759
Larger larger by 20 multiply by 2.5 and you can get S.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:38.489
For 50, right? 5050 microphones.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:45.659
So if, and in the last example.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:48.959
And here we can see the area is.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:53.729
Increased by four times and the gap is.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:53.729 --> 00:15:56.849
Decrease by one over eight.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:15:56.849 --> 00:16:00.689
So you can substitute.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:06.989
You can do the calculations. Now the area is four times.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:06.989 --> 00:16:11.189
And this D becomes one over eight.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:15.239
So overall, it will become.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:22.109
Four, I'm four divided by one over eight.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:31.589
Okay, and one more, I forgot, we forgot the material is NO more air. The material is my car, which is.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:35.639
A five, so that means the excellent R.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:40.769
Is five times now because absent out of air.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:43.829
It's one, so five times.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:49.349
So this means five is there five times.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:55.139
A four is there, but since four divided by one over each is equivalent to.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:16:55.139 --> 00:17:01.529
Four multiply by eight, so overall.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:05.669
You will get, hundred 60 times.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:10.019
Hundred 60 times more than the previous.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:18.119
Previous which is 160 times 1000 of the previous.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:24.869
Compared to the previousants from the previous. So this is how you measure.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:32.819
How you measure the strength of, the presidents. But as because the formula.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.359
Is here, you can see if it is.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:39.509
On the numerator, it means.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:46.169
Five times, area means the area is increased, the capacitance is increased.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:50.039
The material is different from air?

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:56.819
The Presidents is increased. It's the the spacing is increased?

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:59.909
The capacit will be decreased.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:06.239
Because this is the mathematics, the log the logics from the mathematical.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:11.069
The mathematical formula of the, the presidents.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:21.539
So, I will go to, direct.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:29.129 --> 00:18:32.549
And here you can see the materials.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:36.179
Is air? Material is air, but if we insert.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:39.599
Some material usually.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:45.509
This material, you, you cannot insert a conductor.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:50.639
Cause we want a material that is.

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:50.639 --> 00:18:57.359
Similar to air, and this material, this directory. Directory is the opposite.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:18:57.359 --> 00:19:00.989
Dynatric is the opposite of a conductor.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:09.329
So you, you cannot insert copper because, this is a conductor.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:13.769
Copper is a conductor, anything that's the electric such as air.

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:17.069
A plastic, a paper.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:20.969
Glass. This is directly, so if we.

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:20.969 --> 00:19:25.829
Insert, instead of air.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:25.829 --> 00:19:32.039
You can put air in between or you can put any materials such as micro.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:35.579
Any dialectric material, so.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:46.499
So if you put the electric the effects of the electric.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:46.499 --> 00:19:50.759
It will make it aligned, ok? It will make it.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:55.139
The tier is positive charges, so the negative will be attracted.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:55.139 --> 00:19:58.739
Do the positive and the positive will be aligned?

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:05.339
And attracted to the negative charges. So when we have that.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:10.709
The charge, the capacitance, that's why the capacity's value is larger.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.799
When we input, we put.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:21.149
Other than air such as, because air is this one.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:26.279
And if we put the electric materials such as micah or.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:32.009
Paraphine paper, the effect of the capacit's.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:36.569
Is higher. The presence is higher due to this.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:44.729
And the charge is higher when the electric is present. The electric is present.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:44.729 --> 00:20:48.119
So here you can see, the.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:55.319
Capacitors in the lab. So usually it is too, the symbol is too.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:59.489
Equally lang, lines.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:20:59.489 --> 00:21:04.889
But also some books do this symbol, so they are both.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.399
Capacitors, if the capacitors.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:13.079
A variables is measured in.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:18.959
F A R A D, so if we have a variable capacitor that you can.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:23.729
Change, change so the symbol is.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:29.639
Like this there is a arrow arrow and.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:32.819
So you as a because of.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:35.939
The formula, the areas, right? The areas.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:41.369
Is excellent area over.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:44.519
Gap gap distance so the area.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:44.519 --> 00:21:52.769
Is higher, the area is bigger so we we expect a higher value of capacity, so here is a small.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:57.029
A smaller, smaller capacitions, one microfarou.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:00.149
And here is the large capacitance.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:03.269
1000 microforms.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:10.559
Yeah, so the size of the capacitor increases with the capacitor's value.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:18.629
So in the lab, and there are two types of, the presidents. The 1st one, this type is called.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:24.779
Electrolytic type of question.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:29.129
This this type is called film.

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:29.129 --> 00:22:36.719
The type of capacitor, and this the last part C is called the type of capacitors.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:41.429
So you can observe in the laboratories the.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:44.519
And basically, the, the larger.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:49.979
The capacitor's size, the higher the capacitor's value.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:22:53.219 --> 00:23:00.779
But, one way to increase the questions is to sometimes companies.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:05.189
You know is using a rolling.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:05.189 --> 00:23:08.879
Or they Because they can do stacking?

256 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:13.979
And they will insert some, something and it's called in session.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:18.689
Method, this is stacking method, and this is rolling method to increase.

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:28.139
The value of capacits, ok? So have, do you have a Tesla account?

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:33.059
Teslaka? No, NO. Okay, so Teslaka.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:36.989
The piece of battery type of car, right? So that battery.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:49.199
It's the capacity and the it's very big because it needs to store the store the you want to drive how long is the Tesla last?

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:53.609
500 km, so it's fully charged, so you can.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:53.609 --> 00:23:57.389
Five 500 km and, bigger.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:23:57.389 --> 00:24:00.599
The, the application.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:05.819
And that's why it is sometimes it's called a super capacitor.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:08.999
This means the one that is in the.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:13.319
Tesla casts, they have a very big battery.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:16.709
So if you work in Tesla.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:16.709 --> 00:24:20.159
You want to, a battery engineer?

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:27.809
Wants to, because if you create bigger, bigger battery, the car will be too heavy, so you want to.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:41.339
Maximize the s the storage but try not to increase the size of the battery so that is another research or another field is a better electrical or battery engineer.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:45.389
For electric vehicle for electric vehicle.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:56.909
And so the bigger the battery and we have super capacitor, you can you you they will call it as a super capacitor.

274 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:24:56.909 --> 00:25:02.249
So capacitors can be placed in series and parallel?

275 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:02.249 --> 00:25:06.989
So in, if we want to increase the levels of capacitions.

276 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:11.039
We place them in peril if you want to.

277 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:18.509
Decrease the levels of overall the levels of capacitors we place them in series.

278 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:23.879
So, here cause in the substation.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:27.929
They were they were substation and so forth.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:31.199
They need to store the electricity.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:39.539
Accumulation so we have a big see this is as tall as, people, as tall as a human.

282 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:43.379
Are all the capacity banks to store.

283 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:49.769
The electricities before to for storage before being sent to.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:49.769 --> 00:25:57.659
Other places. So this capacitor bank, so that's why it's super capacitors, super capacitors.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:25:57.659 --> 00:26:01.409
But your battery and your laptop is just small?

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:07.589
Small type of capacitors. So series and pedal.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:11.789
So if we have capacitors in parallel.

288 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:16.499
Actually, the total capacitor is added.

289 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:16.499 --> 00:26:20.009
So just capesters in parallel.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:23.639
It's just adding all the Q one plus.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:23.639 --> 00:26:31.079
The value of Q one plus the value of Q two plus the value of Q three, you will get a Q total.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:40.319
Q total as a whole, and if you connect the capacitors in series.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:45.719
You will, it's not the adding.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:48.749
That this means Q total.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:48.749 --> 00:26:54.989
Equals to Q1Q total equals to Q two and.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:26:54.989 --> 00:27:00.599
Q total is equals to Q three.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:04.859
Alright, and.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:09.359
So, this.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:14.249
This Two is in parallel? The blue.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:21.269
The blue and the pink, they are in parallel because they are nothing in between, so and.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:28.319
Let me change the color. So this, the green.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:31.349
All of them are imperal so if.

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:34.859
We know the voltage is, therefore.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:38.429
This also must be E?

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:43.109
The potential is is E and.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:47.339
The potential or the voltage must also be it.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:52.079
So this is also a good revision coming from our midterm exam.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:56.849
Towards the next quiz and also the final exam. You must.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:56.849 --> 00:27:59.999
Observe that.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:06.029
Branches in perils, have the same voltage, have the same voltage.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:12.629
And, so C total.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:12.629 --> 00:28:18.959
Uhh, so a C total is C one.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:23.969
Plus C two plus C three. So that if they are in parallel.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:28.259
But on the other hand, if they are in series.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:31.679
The formula is one over C total?

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:37.529
It's equals to one over C one plus one over C two.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:40.529
Plus one over C three. So these are the.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:40.529 --> 00:28:45.449
Two formulas, one in series, sorry, one in parallel and.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:45.449 --> 00:28:53.879
Capacitors in cities. As an example, if we have, the circuit on the left.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:53.879 --> 00:28:58.829
So we see that they are in cities and we use the formula.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:28:58.829 --> 00:29:06.599
One over C total equals to one over C one plus one over C two plus one over C three.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:11.489
So we can rearrange this to get back to the city.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:11.489 --> 00:29:17.189
Okay, so eight micro products, so you can see.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:24.269
250 and ten, but the the total is smaller, smaller.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:28.079
Smaller than because this is the formula use.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:32.819
So if we have three capacitors in parallel.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:36.299
861200.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:40.199
So we can simply use and C total is.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:40.199 --> 00:29:45.269
C one plus C two and plus C three. So they reproduce.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:50.819
A sea total of 2060 microphones. So this is larger.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:56.999
Larger than the individual capacitors, but when you have in series.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:01.349
The total is smaller than the individual capacitors.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:08.489
Okay, and.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:08.489 --> 00:30:15.869
Here we have, everything is opposite to resistance.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:15.869 --> 00:30:22.739
Okay, so because it's resistors, if you remember they are when you have in series.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:26.939
You add them, right? When you have, in series.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:34.169
The total resistors will be added. So, but here the capacitors when they are.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:34.169 --> 00:30:44.009
In series, it is the opposite it's like resistors in parallel. And similarly when resistors are in parallel.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:51.809
When they are in federal, you, you also.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:58.649
If you still remember R one of over Rt is one over R one.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:01.709
The Plus one over to.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:01.709 --> 00:31:07.589
Plus one over at three. So any and and and.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:07.589 --> 00:31:10.949
So in essence capacitor's formula.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:10.949 --> 00:31:17.999
It's the opposite to the resistance formula in series and in parallel. So if we have.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:23.039
If you have the circuit on the left, so we know that.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:26.369
He's too, in.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:26.369 --> 00:31:31.079
Parallel alright? So these two are in parallel.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:35.489
And so therefore.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:40.019
We want.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:44.039
So it's, so when when they are in parallel.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:49.769
We add the root capacitors, right? Because it's the opposite, so at the end we can just draw.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:49.769 --> 00:31:52.889
And the summary summary circuits.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:52.889 --> 00:31:58.469
Off, and these two.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:03.479
Are these two as a resultant is just six, right? If you agree?

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:03.479 --> 00:32:09.299
Because they are imperal, and this is three.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:14.189
So this is three, and this is 120 votes.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:18.629
This is three microphorats and.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:24.449
Six microforts. So at down.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:24.449 --> 00:32:27.719
It's just like a voltage divider. Again, it's a revision.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:37.349
From the midterm and also for future, so just redraw it like this if you want to make.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:37.349 --> 00:32:42.839
Visually more clear, so this is 120 v.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:49.109
And if you want to make it clearer, if you want V one.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:49.109 --> 00:32:52.439
Or if you want me too.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:56.879
You can use the voltage divider theory and I hope.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:32:56.879 --> 00:33:01.409
Is a well verse to you by now the voltage divided theory is.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:01.409 --> 00:33:06.989
And so we want.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:14.009
Yeah, here is three. Let me write here three and here is six.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:20.249
So here it's six and so the voltage.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:20.249 --> 00:33:29.339
And, ok, and we want is.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:36.599
Six over, three plus six multiplied by 01:20. So it is.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:40.169
Are the opposite to the.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:46.199
To the resistors, ok, to the registers, so it's all everything is opposite.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:53.459
And here we have the 2nd, the 2nd.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:53.459 --> 00:33:56.519
The 2nd circuits, so here.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:33:56.519 --> 00:34:05.729
We can So V two.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:05.729 --> 00:34:09.419
Equals, 2V3.

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:14.159
Which is V total V total and.

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:17.249
V two is, 120.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:17.249 --> 00:34:20.939
The three over three plus six?

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:20.939 --> 00:34:25.139
Three over three plus six divided by 01:20.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.409
So it's the opposite of the.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:34.499
Uhh S resistors, the opposite of the resistors.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:44.669
So the, now it's the, the more interesting part is the.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:49.439
Capacity in steady states. So because when you have your laptop.

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:49.439 --> 00:34:52.439
Or your tesla cars or your.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:52.439 --> 00:34:55.559
Your mobile phone, you are going to charge.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:34:55.559 --> 00:35:01.439
Charge your battery, right? Charge the battery in your mobile phone.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:01.439 --> 00:35:06.329
Okay, so now, when it is.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:06.329 --> 00:35:12.269
Start from nothing, start from zero. So when you start to charge.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:12.269 --> 00:35:17.429
When you start to charge, ok?

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:23.759
It is, a short circuit.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:23.759 --> 00:35:28.079
So at this T zero, when you start to charge your battery.

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:36.089
A mobile phone battery it is the capacitor acts like a short circuit.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:36.089 --> 00:35:41.729
Okay, so this is capacitor, this is a capacitor.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:41.729 --> 00:35:51.389
So cause now you will charge your capacitor X as a short circuit. So after a certain while, a long time.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:59.189
And, long long after a certain time, after a certain time.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:35:59.189 --> 00:36:03.149
Fully charged, the capacitor will.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:03.149 --> 00:36:06.299
A act like an open circuit.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:10.649
To store, to store the energy. So just remember.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:18.479
For a capacitor, when it is D equals to zero, when you start charging, when the switch is closed.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:18.479 --> 00:36:21.539
It will act as opposite?

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:25.649
So after a long while, after is fully charged.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:25.649 --> 00:36:29.519
This means it will act.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:34.349
As a short as open circuit. So S C.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:38.069
A short circuit in the beginning and opened circuits.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:43.409
At the, at the end. So this means.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:46.529
When it is fully charged?

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:46.529 --> 00:36:49.739
This will, this capacitance.

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:55.709
Will look like an open circuit. So therefore, there is like a.

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:55.709 --> 00:36:59.879
That is like a curve or the voltage.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:36:59.879 --> 00:37:02.969
See the voltage across the capacitor.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:08.729
This means when it is zero, when it is a zero time?

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:08.729 --> 00:37:14.609
The voltage is zero, and it is understandable and logical because.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:18.449
And when time is zero, it is.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:18.449 --> 00:37:21.869
An open circuit, so if we measure.

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:26.039
The voltage, a voltage seat.

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:31.499
There is NO potential difference, so the voltage is zero.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:37.049
But as time goes as you charge, so the voltage across sea.

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:40.829
Increases, increases until.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:43.949
The fully charged and this.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:47.189
It's visit, because.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:47.189 --> 00:37:53.249
Then it is fully charged, it becomes an open circuit, so the voltage.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:53.249 --> 00:37:58.499
In an open circuit, the voltage.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:37:58.499 --> 00:38:02.999
What is VC. And similarly.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:02.999 --> 00:38:06.839
The current, so now this is voltage.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:10.829
I hope I explained because this is very important.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:14.970
So the when the voltage is zero.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.930
Which is, I will draw it here, which is.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.080
And when it acts like an open circuit?

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.190
And this is maximum, it acts like an.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.660
Sorry, it acts a short circuit, and this is open circuit.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.590
So when it is open circuit, sorry, the short circuit.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.820
The current, the current.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.170
Is flowing, right? The current is flowing so the current is maximum.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.620
But when it is.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.830
Become, open circuit.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:53.670
Therefore, NO current will flow.

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.800
So, so I hope this is the initial concept.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.640
This means for a capacitor.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:09.480
When you start at T equals to zero, it acts like a short circuit.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.620
When you are fully charged, the capacitor.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.730
Appears like an open circuit. So logically.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:23.310
When it is, a short circup?

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.700
The voltage must be zero in between.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:33.570
Then it increases, it becomes an open circuit than the voltage is busy.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.900
And on the other hand, voltage and current is.

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:43.440
Complimentary, this means when it is short circuit, current will flow, this means current is maximum.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.590
But as we.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.310
As we go charging and so forth.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.930
As this turns into a open circuit, the current is.

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.430
Zero. The current is approaching zero. So I hope.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.580
Are you.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.200
This is the fundamental concept of a capacitor charging.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.910
Charging and later we will learn discharging.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:17.520
Discharging. Any questions so far?

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:24.180
Any questions? So I hope never mind.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.110
We will see one good example here, ok?

458 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.460
So when completely charged, the capacitor.

459 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.590
It's like an open circuit. So F in your mind at T equals to zero.

460 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:42.750
The capestor is a short circuit wire, but when you charge it.

461 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:48.120
From the voltage supply, the capacitor holds energy.

462 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.210
And now the capacitor appear like an.

463 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:56.610
Open circuit and.

464 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:02.100
So when it is a open circuit, it appears as.

465 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:09.600
Yeah, of course, open circuit. When it is fully charged, this is open circuit. So we can.

466 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:16.200
Now, say that, so if I redraw this, so when this is an open circuit.

467 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.530
So actually this line is like.

468 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:25.230
And irrelevant because NO current, NO current withflow through this.

469 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:35.340
All the current towards here. So then I redraw it in this manner, so 24 votes, four ombs here and eight omps.

470 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.180
And VC is looking.

471 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.710
At here. So we see it's looking at here and.

472 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:51.990
I hope you sty you can relate from the previous knowledge that this is a voltage divider.

473 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:58.560
So we see a voltage across capacitor voltage divider means it's.

474 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:07.560
Eight over twelve multiply by 24 votes, so 16 votes. Okay.

475 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.190
Sixteens votes. Yes.

476 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.320
Oh, so when the.

477 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.910
When we talk about yeah yes.

478 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.560
That one is when it is capacity as not.

479 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.070
Analyzing as a fully charged just like a.

480 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:41.340
Two capacities like that. But when we talk about capacity as fully charged, we.

481 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:45.090
We have to analyze it as a becoming an op.

482 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:49.530
And becoming an open circuit, but actually it's not.

483 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.770
Totally the work gets.

484 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:56.760
Because in this previous previous one.

485 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.960
It is analyzing a capacitor.

486 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.880
There there is NO resistance at all, right? There's NO resistance, but here.

487 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:12.270
It is, when the or fully charged, this is.

488 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:19.290
Like an open secret, so we are analyzing in terms of resistance.

489 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:23.970
For the rule? Yes.

490 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.480
Yes yes.

491 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:33.180
Yeah, this for the capacity rule, you mean?

492 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.720
Both is divide the rule?

493 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.770
And the opposite register is current divider.

494 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:47.490
The current divider rule look at the opposite branch. No, NO.

495 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.810
Yes, so that's why I, this.

496 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:59.190
Previous slide, this one, yeah? Previous slide. So this.

497 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.630
Previous slides and it's a good question. This.

498 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.690
Is related to capacitors only.

499 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:10.470
I mean we are not analyzing, there are NO resistors here?

500 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:16.110
There are NO, all our capacitors, so it's like a standalone analysis.

501 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:23.940
Stand alone, we are not talking about it's fully charged or not. So if we have just capacity.

502 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:30.060
Capacitors like standalone analysis, if these two capacity like this, the rule is opposite.

503 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.510
Yeah, but now we.

504 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.780
We are, we are normal.

505 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:46.260
Analyzing as a standalone, now the capacitor is charged fully charged. So it now it is back to the resistance.

506 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.880
Okay, yes. So in terms of exam.

507 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.600
More on, a hundred percent is.

508 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.770
From this side, not from, I will not ask.

509 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:09.240
From the standalone capacity, so just from now onwards, it's more important from from this side from this site. Charging and discharging charging.

510 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.840
And discharge. So.

511 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.530
So, but if you want to find the.

512 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.400
Cause the relationship between Q.

513 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.680
And I see is equals to QV, if you want.

514 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.400
So usually that is the final answer, but if the question further said what is the value?

515 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.520
But During this time, what is the value of charge?

516 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.590
So Q is CB and C is, 20.

517 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:52.380
So Q is CBC is 20 microforax.

518 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.850
And of course we if we see during this fully charged.

519 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:03.240
A V is 16 votes. And of course you can use.

520 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:10.440
You can get your answers. So that is put in your, the 1st important principle.

521 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.760
Capacity at T equals to zero, it is.

522 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.790
Acting like a short circuit wire?

523 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:24.270
But as it's fully charged, imagine like mobile phone battery when it's fully charged.

524 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:28.890
The capacitor looks like an open circuit.

525 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:34.200
So that is, the, the 1st important principle.

526 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:47.700
For capacitors. So we, when we fully charged sometimes you you can also the, the naming is called capacitor in steady states.

527 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:53.370
This mean it's already steady that you cannot charge anymore. It's steady steady state.

528 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.600
So in this situation, it's also interesting.

529 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.890
So when is this like long time steady state?

530 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:07.950
You can see here there are two capacitors. This circuit has two capacitors.

531 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:12.000
So, the theory is, says that.

532 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.990
When it is long time after steady State of fully charge?

533 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.350
It acts, it looks like an open circuit?

534 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:24.870
Yeah, it looks like an open circuit, so I I will draw it, I will.

535 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:31.620
So what happened when, what happened to the current at this moment?

536 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.880
So here, at this junction.

537 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.680
This that is it's supposed to be split, right?

538 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.390
But here there is nothing, so, there, there is NO current flowing here.

539 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.100
And it will go through here. So this.

540 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:57.540
At this junction, it's supposed to split, but you can see it is an open circuit.

541 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.540
At the moment, so this will be.

542 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.530
Nothing. And actually, when it is nothing.

543 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:09.660
So this is irrelevant, right?

544 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:15.780
This is, it's like NO NO current flows, nothing. So at the end.

545 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.130
When it is fully charged or steady state?

546 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:24.360
We only have a situation.

547 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:30.690
Of this one and this one.

548 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:34.380
This is the two oms and the seven oms.

549 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.940
And, 72 votes. And this is.

550 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.810
No more connected. So when we asked.

551 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:48.180
When we asked to find what is VC one?

552 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:55.470
So VC one is, this is nothing, I mean VC one is.

553 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:03.300
From here to here, and it's also from here to here is the same because.

554 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.380
Yes, this, this one is looking in this.

555 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.730
In this and when when you look here you are looking at.

556 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.240
This one, so BC one is this one.

557 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.500
And we see two, so now I I erase this.

558 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:24.240
It is this. So VC two is looking.

559 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.330
Yeah, VC two is looking.

560 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:31.500
In here, but here is.

561 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.770
Coming nothing, so I will.

562 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:40.080
I'll redraw it. So actually the VC two.

563 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:47.400
It's, it's looking like this cost.

564 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.850
Here is becoming like not so VC two can be brought.

565 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:58.560
I like, so if you see irrelevant, so I I just draw the seven oms here.

566 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.420
Suppose VC two is here, right? VC two is here, but why not?

567 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:10.230
I'll make it busy to, here because there's nothing, so it's like.

568 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.410
I'm looking at here.

569 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.220
So this one is I'm looking in this.

570 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.810
In this banner and VC two, actually it's looking here but.

571 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.290
Extend it, so VC two is here.

572 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:32.010
So in other words, so if I redraw it.

573 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:38.160
I know that you you can, some of you, most of you will be able to to.

574 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.790
To discover already but I like to.

575 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.380
Show it in clarity. So this, this one.

576 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:51.060
Yeah, two, two is here, seven is here.

577 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.710
So it's like a voltage a divider theory.

578 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:50:55.710 --> 00:51:00.270
So if you want, this is VC one.

579 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.690
And this is a visitude.

580 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:08.550
And again, you use your voltage divided theory which states.

581 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:12.870
That VC One is two over 9th.

582 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.650
Two overnights are multiplied by 72.

583 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:22.290
VC two VC two is seven over 9th multiply over 72.

584 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:29.760
So this is a capacitor in steady state or fully charged, fully charged.

585 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:36.090
Seems that there is NO quiz.

586 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:41.310
My script, I don't know why, maybe I will give free marks or.

587 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:45.210
I, I said it but.

588 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:49.260
I didn't see where is the quiz? Let me check.

589 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.180
The real, the real want, whether it is here.

590 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:58.950
Oh uh.

591 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:06.930
See the D here, today this is 19 May, maybe.

592 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:13.290
I forgot to save as a new.

593 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:17.280
Oh, there is a quiz, but we already went through.

594 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.100
So, the 1st question will be free marks, I think.

595 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.690
So let's continue with, where, where we stop.

596 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:31.890
So I already I already.

597 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:34.920
Went through this, this.

598 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:42.180
With you just now, and before that, we have NO questions at all.

599 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:48.840
Only one question, which is this one.

600 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.430
Yeah, so, so for the benefit.

601 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.700
For the benefit, so it was my.

602 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:00.300
A mistake. I didn't click the the right.

603 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:06.990
I get the quiz, so this means I will show the answer.

604 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:11.340
And after, after we click the quiz, you will be.

605 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.550
So the quiz will ask you.

606 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:21.900
And what is VC? And what is VC?

607 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.470
You use the voltage divider rule?

608 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:32.100
This is what is VC. Okay I The 1st one I give you the answer.

609 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:37.140
So because I missed the quiz and now I will click.

610 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:42.240
If you see the lectures folder, 2024.

611 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.550
In class quiz lecture six because today is lecture six on Wednesday.

612 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:53.520
So I will, I will write it to be.

613 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:58.770
A Wednesday, the 22 of May.

614 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:06.390
20 2024. So I will.

615 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:11.790
I'm safe, 2024 here because.

616 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:16.080
I need to use for tomorrow's batch as well.

617 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:22.500
So 20 2048.

618 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:29.040
Safe S 2024B for.

619 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.660
Tomorrow's tomorrow's batch, tomorrow's students.

620 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:40.620
And just save extra extra one more for next year, for next year?

621 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:47.340
I can use for next year's batch, ok? So this.

622 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:53.280
Is the C, and.

623 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.550
So the question is, what is.

624 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.000
VC. What is VC?

625 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.500
And I think you know this is a voltage divider room.

626 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.960
And, so you can continue.

627 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.010
For 200 s, what is VC?

628 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:39.000
So what is this VC?

629 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.770
So I can just have a look with the progress or very good.

630 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:48.420
51 students or 50 students are in this room.

631 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:53.910
At the moment, 50 students.

632 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:55:53.910 --> 00:56:02.850
It was quite a good number of students, so I think you you are able to do the answers I will reveal.

633 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.260
So this is the 1st question, ok?

634 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.290
I think you, you know the answers.

635 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:16.140
And 2nd, what is.

636 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:22.380
VC one, and what is VC two?

637 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.160
So what is VC one and what is VC two?

638 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:38.040
So which from the previous question, we have.

639 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:44.130
Another, so I just, just give a chance.

640 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:50.700
So students can enter the previous question 1st.

641 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:56.040
Before we start, what is BC one and what is BC two?

642 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:20.520
I think, 75 s is the 1st time.

643 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:40.140
50 s and let me see how many students have.

644 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:46.140
I have, 70 students, 69, so.

645 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:50.040
Just a little bit more before we continue.

646 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:55.740
To what is V VC one and what is VC two.

647 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.150
1918, six.

648 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:26.700
6543 three.

649 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:30.180
Two one ok then.

650 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.990
Let's continue with, what is VC one?

651 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:41.340
Okay. So what is BC one?

652 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:47.250
You will be, you will select the answer once we see one.

653 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:54.960
So here is VC one, VC one.

654 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.280
This voltage divided theory, the VC one.

655 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:31.610
Okay. Okay.

656 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:35.730
And the next one is, what is.

657 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:42.390
VC two, let me wait for one.

658 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:46.710
So, you see one is two over.

659 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:51.810
Two over nine multiply by 72.

660 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:56.910
Okay. And the next question.

661 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
00:59:56.910 --> 01:00:03.510
Is what is VC two, so I'll just click.

662 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:09.720
Do one more, the next click for after this version finish finishes.

663 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:32.010
Okay, I think it's almost finished. So let's go to the next question.

664 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.510
And the next question what is VC two?

665 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:53.910
And what is VC two?

666 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.800
So while waiting, just to emphasize again?

667 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.550
A steady statements the capacitor is.

668 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:14.520
Wholly charged after a certain while. So in the beginning.

669 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.250
In the beginning, so capacitor.

670 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.750
In the beginning, the capacitor looks like a short circuit wire.

671 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:29.100
As it is charging and fully charged.

672 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.230
After a certain time, the capacitor will look.

673 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.470
Like, open circuit.

674 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:50.220
Open 2nd, but still we look like an open 2nd, so if we draw.

675 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.660
This, this means the voltage.

676 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:00.090
And the time, the voltage is zero because.

677 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:08.130
It's a short circuit wire and the voltage.

678 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:12.180
It's busy after us some time.

679 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:16.710
And the current, the current is.

680 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:21.510
Maximum, because it's a short circuit the current timeflow.

681 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:29.160
But as it changes the current will approach zero.

682 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.770
So the pink is the current and the green is the voltage.

683 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.780
VC two or VC VC two, ok?

684 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:03.120
So we see two and so an ideally capacitor does not dissipate any of the energies applied to it.

685 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:09.450
So it stores the energy in the form of electric field between the conducting surfaces.

686 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:20.730
So here is, as I mentioned just now, this is the voltage.

687 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.150
So this, this is the.

688 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:29.220
The voltage of the paster it starts from zero because.

689 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.640
It's like a short circuit wire and it will.

690 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.230
At the steady state, it will approach.

691 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:41.460
E And Karen.

692 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.020
The current is voltage over resistance.

693 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:52.020
So this is the current, so for a short circuit wire.

694 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.220
Here and here it's a open circuit.

695 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.620
So the current flows, the maximum, and then.

696 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:06.510
It will approach zero. When it is open NO current.

697 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.140
Fully open circuit NO current will flow.

698 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.650
So since one site is.

699 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:18.120
Voltage and the one side is current.

700 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.730
So power is voltage multiplied by current, so each.

701 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:28.890
This maybe let's say ten, this is zero, so the resultant is zero.

702 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:32.100
This point multiply by this point.

703 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.370
You got this. E.g., this.

704 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:39.270
At this point multiply by this point.

705 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:46.530
We get this. At this point multiply by this point we get this.

706 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:51.510
These two points are same and we got this. So this, this is.

707 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.750
The curves of the voltage?

708 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.370
Of the current and the curve for the power.

709 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:05.460
Get the curve for the power as well, ok?

710 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.890
The energy stocked is represented by the shadowed area under the power.

711 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:17.340
So the shaded area, under the power curve is the energy.

712 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:22.770
Cause, a power is energy.

713 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:28.110
Over time, so the energy is power.

714 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:38.730
Multiply by time. So that is the relationship between voltage, current power and energy.

715 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:43.080
So with that, I would take 5 min breaks.

716 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:49.650
We'll take 5 min breaks and after that we will continue with our capacitors.

717 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:54.420
More details about the capacitors, ok? So.

718 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2065579776)
01:05:54.420 --> 01:06:00.324
See you after 5 min.
