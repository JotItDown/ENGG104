00:01:43.800 --> 00:02:03.800
Hello.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.880
What do you.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
Morning everyone, hopefully everyone.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.660
Safe and well, again, my name is every Monday.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.120
And that will be will be.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.070
Teaching the lectures and, uh, nice to see.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.300
Many of you again I was the team.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.840
That's 1 for 1. that's.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.820
Last dismiss, so.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.500
Today we are going to cover lecture 2.

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.930
And also, we, we are going to, we're going to lecture, we are going to.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.230
As we will, you will attend some quizzes some.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.970
Short quizzes why we go to go to the lecture.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.780
Okay, but it's not started yet. It's not started here.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.960
So, when we reach that point, we are going to start it with and then we.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.500
Stop and then we reach another point we will restart, uh, resume the quiz.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.970
So, previously, in, during last week we covered, um, that's 1. we covered, uh, charge.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.510
Columns, uh, we covered.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.830
We saw that the waltz, the voltage.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.950
The unit was is also can be.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.930
Can also be, uh, represented as.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:23.940
Energy charge or column, so these are the 2 units of both voltage and that we learned that, um.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.519
The current is, but the current is also.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:34.049
Hold on for a 2nd, Josh over time.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:47.279
And we learned batteries, and also, last week we learned about batteries and, uh, the electron mechanical approach, such as generators.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:55.439
And we learned all slot we, we, it was to, Ah.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.689
Today we are going to cover.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.579
Uh, energy and power the relationship between energy and power.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:10.229
Which is power is energy over time.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.979
W, is energy power is energy over time.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.739
We are going to, uh, recover a series in series.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:24.629
Adding voltage sources that resistance in series.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.129
What will happen? Uh, cut jobs what.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.769
We are going to learn voltage divider role and real voltage source.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:47.069
So our is related to energy is in such a way that, uh, power is energy.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.469
Over time, so power is the rate at which the energy is delivered.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:05:52.469 --> 00:06:01.799
Or used up and is measured in Jews per 2nd, so, W should not be confused with, uh.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:05.039
In this case W, is energy.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.449
And the unit is Joe's so power.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:21.329
Is, uh, what what what but power can also be the unique can also be, uh, represented as for a 2nd energy over time.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:26.849
So, since, uh, and it, a power is energy over time.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.659
Therefore, energy is equals to power multiplied by time.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:42.569
So, as an example, uh, if we have 10 works, so power is 10 works.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.129
Applying it applying the power for 5 seconds. We get.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.669
50 jobs of energy, so.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:06:50.669 --> 00:07:03.509
So this is the simple formula, which I expect you to remember that it's very short. Uh, it's very short. It's good. It's highly recommended to memorize.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:13.049
And let's relate, uh, power, energy and resistance. Let's relay them.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:18.089
So we know from last week that I will.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:24.749
Yep, so we know from last week, uh, that, um.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:29.039
Our voltage of course is both, but.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.929
Both the, uh, voltage is, uh.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:39.599
Energy energy is W over charge so.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:42.749
What voltage.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:45.809
Is, uh, energy per column.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:54.629
And we also know from the previous slides in the previous slides that the power power is.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:59.039
Energy over time, so if we.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.909
The power is.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:06.029
Energy over time.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:12.329
So we know from last week's material, that energy.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:16.919
Oh, voltage is energy.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:22.679
Charge, so this is W, and this is W, so we can.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:27.149
All right that power is.

63 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:33.659
Over time.

64 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:39.089
So this is the 1st, we are using, uh, the relationship.

65 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:42.599
To be between voltage energy and.

66 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.499
Charge and also I will.

67 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:53.729
Energy and time, and last week also we learned that, um.

68 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:56.759
Last week also, we learned that, uh.

69 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:01.259
A carton of course, it's but Karen is.

70 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:06.839
You over the column per 2nd.

71 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:13.559
Therefore, therefore.

72 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:16.919
This cue over here here.

73 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:22.679
And this is therefore.

74 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:28.859
Power from this village from derivation. The power is.

75 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:32.339
Iv, so power is also.

76 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:36.419
I V, so the power is.

77 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:39.779
Both multiply by, uh, current.

78 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:43.079
And last weeks we learned.

79 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:49.139
The old slow be equals to.

80 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:56.729
Last week we learned, uh, from home slot so we can now.

81 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:01.769
If we want to express it, we can also express the equals to.

82 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:06.929
But I, I, from the own slow.

83 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:10.409
This, uh, we overall.

84 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:16.589
So, therefore, here I is.

85 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:21.779
So, we can, so we over.

86 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:28.319
We can also be expressed as, uh, we square voltage Square.

87 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:34.979
But if you want to substitute, uh, B, because here, we, it's.

88 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:40.649
Equals to therefore.

89 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:45.569
Uh, can also be express.

90 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:52.169
Power can also be expressed by ice where, uh.

91 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:59.189
So, power is the eye. What.

92 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:02.369
Power is the square over.

93 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:02.369 --> 00:11:13.979
And power is also I Square, depending on the situation, you can use, uh, relevant formulas, the relevant formulas.

94 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:25.079
Thanks so these are the, we, we just derived from last week's, uh, the materials step by step.

95 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:29.759
And we got vehicles to be.

96 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:38.549
It has to be squared over and it goes to ice Square is resistance resistance.

97 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:46.559
So, if that is.

98 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:52.499 --> 00:11:57.809
Um, so let's see, power and energy.

99 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:11:57.809 --> 00:12:01.229
Oh, so.

100 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:01.229 --> 00:12:06.359
If, uh, kilowatt hour cost 25 cents.

101 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:11.909
In or in in any place in 25 cents.

102 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:11.909 --> 00:12:15.209
How much does it cost to light up?

103 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:19.499
When the when do you what.

104 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:23.399
No power like 1 year.

105 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:29.459
So, remember, um.

106 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:34.559
So, 1 year is 300.

107 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:40.589
And 65 days, right? That's 365 days.

108 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:43.649
So.

109 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:48.749
In 1 day they are, there is 24 hours.

110 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:48.749 --> 00:12:52.289
It is 24 hours, so.

111 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:58.739
In 1 year, so let's see the relationship. So we have.

112 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:03.809
Time 1st time is the number of.

113 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:06.989
Because the 1 year is considered time.

114 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:11.819
Uh, we have power power is B.

115 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:11.819 --> 00:13:18.029
What is B right? Power is 21 is B time is.

116 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:24.029
1 year, so what is the relationship that we learned from last.

117 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:27.659
Previous slide. We, it goes to.

118 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:36.959
Uh, W, poverty where W is.

119 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:43.979
So so this means now you can see the relationship.

120 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:48.779
Okay and, uh, so let's.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:52.739
Uh, click, uh, the, let's click the.

122 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:57.449
I think you use your template already. Um, uh, let's.

123 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:13:57.449 --> 00:14:03.689
Start so this is in the lectures folder. Let's just folder and.

124 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)

126 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:15.989
Since this is the 1st question, I.

127 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:21.689
I gave it 200 seconds plus maybe it takes time to look.

128 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:25.949
To load the program, so the 1st question.

129 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:32.339
It'll be will be longer will be 200 seconds.

130 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.789
So, I will call this, um.

134 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:14.129
So so let's start this session so this discussion, this session does not start yet.

135 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:18.539
Uh, because I didn't press the start with.

136 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:23.729
So, I think, um, everybody is ready.

137 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:30.089
Everybody is ready I think so I will start degrees and the 1st question.

138 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:36.569
You have 100 seconds so this is.

139 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:41.549
Um, so I get some time.

140 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:51.149
Cause you might need to come to load up, do not have the 1st for the 1st time for the 1st time.

141 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:56.009
So this is the, the question.

142 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:15:56.009 --> 00:16:00.179
On the screen, and from your device, you can select the best.

143 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:04.799
The best answer and the correct answer. The correct.

144 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:21.089
Ah, 21.

145 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:27.959
This is the 1st, 1, not the 4th will be the next question. Let's see.

146 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:34.229
So, let me see the response.

147 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:34.229 --> 00:16:37.319
So very good 45 students.

148 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:45.119
12:16:we still still deciding 14 is still deciding.

149 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:50.669
So, here, i46 students, uh, at times that.

150 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:54.089
This lecture, so I would like to give, um.

151 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:16:54.089 --> 00:17:00.599
Recommendation for the attendance, so well, done this. That's good.

152 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:06.629
It's very good and, um, and so these are the choices and.

153 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:15.089
So so, let me see, um, um.

154 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:18.149
So, the 1st question, I have.

155 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:22.859
Many, um, and I hope I give you 1:2:seconds.

156 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:26.339
So this means, um.

157 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.959
25 students left, not attempting yet. Uh, huh.

158 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:35.549
For the 43 students have already attempted, so that's.

159 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:40.349
And that's a good. That's good. So I think I will.

160 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:44.969
I will just display the and.

161 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:44.969 --> 00:17:50.819
So, this the answer is 175.

162 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:55.259
Fine 2 kilowatt hour.

163 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:17:55.259 --> 00:18:03.659
You know what? So, just be careful with the kilo uh, what so here here because.

164 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:03.659 --> 00:18:11.969
You know what so 265 days and they are.

165 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:11.969 --> 00:18:17.939
24 hours in 1 day. So 175.2kilowatt no.

166 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:17.939 --> 00:18:22.559
So, can I see the response.

167 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:30.629
So that's great. Um, majority.

168 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:30.629 --> 00:18:36.779
Got it right? I mean, vast majority got it right? And.

169 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:36.779 --> 00:18:41.039
Let me see the timer. How many seconds left.

170 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:45.269
9th, uh, it.

171 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:49.559
7, so we are going to see.

172 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:52.949
So 0 seconds.

173 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:57.839
So well done you already collected? No.

174 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:03.449
For your for your overall grades for your overall months.

175 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:03.449 --> 00:19:12.059
So, then the next question is, uh, will you have 100 seconds but if I see that.

176 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:15.509
Uh, all of most of you have answered, so I can.

177 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:20.129
I can press press stop the civil.

178 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:20.129 --> 00:19:24.599
For instance, last week we can go ahead for the next 1. so.

179 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:31.439
So, the cost is 175 because the question asked us how much does it cost.

180 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:31.439 --> 00:19:38.459
To light up so now we know that's 175.2kilowatt hour and.

181 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:45.419
Uh, but the 1 kilowatt hour cost 25 cents. So I think that it's a bonus question for you.

182 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:48.509
Uh, so you just, uh, click.

183 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:53.609
The next question is find the.

184 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:57.479
The costs find the cross.

185 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:00.779
Find the cost, uh, in.

186 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:00.779 --> 00:20:04.679
For for using 1 year for using.

187 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:10.199
21 low power, like continuously for 1 year.

188 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:13.409 --> 00:20:31.139
So.

189 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:31.139 --> 00:20:36.509
Think, um, can you, you got it.

190 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:20:36.509 --> 00:20:41.339
In all of you got it got the right 1.

191 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:02.449 --> 00:21:10.769
Yes.

192 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:15.179
It didn't participants online, so it's.

193 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:18.899
And here we have, um, so.

194 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:18.899 --> 00:21:24.149
So, in total we have more than 40, which is very, very good.

195 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:28.739
Very good. So, let me see how many students left.

196 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:37.799
11 students, uh, still, uh, not attempting, not still thinking so, give it, um.

197 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:42.569
But we can also see at a time, or is it over.

198 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:48.899
Over already yes, I think it's over.

199 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:48.899 --> 00:21:52.049
So, we can proceed to the, um.

200 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:56.489
To the next, uh, next slide.

201 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:21:56.489 --> 00:22:00.509
So, 43.8dollars 3.8dollars.

202 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:07.289
So, let's, uh, let's do the next 3 questions.

203 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:10.499
So, a portable television uses.

204 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:10.499 --> 00:22:16.289
Of both, uh, 3 empty hours we learned from last week, 3 and 3 hours battery.

205 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:16.289 --> 00:22:22.289
Over a period of 5.5hours when the battery is empty.

206 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:30.539
So, what is the energy expanded by the battery during this period?

207 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:34.559
So, we have here, uh.

208 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:38.279
1st of all, what what is the average current.

209 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:43.169
Um, Ron, Ron, by.

210 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:43.169 --> 00:22:48.869
But, uh, what's the average time drawn during this period?

211 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:54.359
Okay, so I just give some hints that costs.

212 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:58.529
Uh, battery life over time, right?

213 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:07.859
Because so, sorry for the this 1, uh, battery life is, uh, M, yeah, our.

214 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:13.049
Because this is like, MPR.

215 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:13.049 --> 00:23:18.479
And time is so.

216 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:26.789
This will get us, which is our current, which is our current. So with that, uh, I will give you.

217 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:33.359
100 seconds to find what is the current? What is the time.

218 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:37.739
So, with this, uh.

219 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:41.819
So, I can see 9995% correct?

220 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:47.849
For every time, uh, every time there is a question so that's good. Be good for you.

221 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:55.049
Good for your productivity and so this is contribute towards your marks at the M.

222 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:23:55.049 --> 00:24:15.049
At the end of the office.

223 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:40.409
I think, uh, let me see how many.

224 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:47.429
Many students so far, um, 7 more students still.

225 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:53.999
Still not attempting, I mean, we will, uh, just wait for 1.

226 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:24:53.999 --> 00:25:07.709
5 more students, 5, most events, I think it's okay. Almost there. So I will reveal.

227 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:14.129
So, um, so it's 0.545Mbps.

228 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:20.009
So, the next 1 is the power.

229 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:24.599
What is the relationship because we have the current.

230 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:24.599 --> 00:25:29.429
I don't however we want the power.

231 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:38.699
So, what is the best? What is the relationship between the IV? Sorry? This is our.

232 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:41.789
Hi, is, uh, is there.

233 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:48.689
We want B, we wanted to find 3 so what else we can find him.

234 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:48.689 --> 00:25:53.639
Yeah, okay. So.

235 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:58.829
I so we know I know we know we.

236 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:02.159
So, let us find be.

237 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:07.199
And so, let me check, but, uh, we just finished.

238 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:11.879
So, it's finished and again regulation.

239 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:11.879 --> 00:26:17.099
53 students got it right? And.

240 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:17.099 --> 00:26:20.459
53 are off 56.

241 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:24.659
So B, equals to IV so power.

242 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:28.259
So, let's let's look at the next question.

243 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:45.209
Jim.

244 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:26:51.599 --> 00:27:11.599
C.

245 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:17.549
Let's see the progress so far.

246 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:24.719
17 students still, um, 15 students.

247 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:24.719 --> 00:27:29.249
12 out of 57, 57.

248 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:38.459
Does it check again?

249 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:43.709
When it tends to this less, you have to answer 9.

250 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:43.709 --> 00:27:49.319
Students left. Okay. So I think, um.

251 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:54.959
Let's say ready. We are almost there, so it's okay.

252 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:54.959 --> 00:27:59.189
65551.

253 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:27:59.189 --> 00:28:04.079
So, we have now, um, uh, I.

254 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:09.539
We have we have the value of the.

255 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:17.319
So, we want the last part is to find the energy energy if.

256 "Dev" (353616896)
00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:20.465
Yeah, yeah.

257 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:28.709
Is W, so what is the relationship that we can use to find the energy?

258 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:28.709 --> 00:28:33.059
Okay.

259 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:33.059 --> 00:28:36.179
All the time, so this.

260 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:44.129
That's so our time in power.

261 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:48.719
This energy over time.

262 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:55.889
Power is energy over time because, uh, we have power.

263 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:28:55.889 --> 00:29:00.059
We have and we have.

264 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:05.489
Okay, so.

265 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:05.489 --> 00:29:08.639
We have follow up.

266 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:12.989
We so.

267 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:12.989 --> 00:29:18.809
Power is energy over time.

268 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:23.159
So, energy is.

269 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:30.239
Decline, so this is energy is power by by time.

270 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:38.189
And again, population 100% 100%. So the next.

271 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:42.989
We will have 100 seconds to answer the.

272 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:47.429
The next.

273 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:51.559
The next thing to keep question.

274 "Dev" (353616896)
00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:56.009
Um, but, um.

275 "Dev" (353616896)
00:29:56.009 --> 00:30:02.879
Oh.

276 "Dev" (353616896)
00:30:02.879 --> 00:30:09.539
Right.

277 "Dev" (353616896)
00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:14.879
Hold on.

278 "Dev" (353616896)
00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:20.535
I don't know. So.

279 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:27.059
Think I'm quite straightforward. I believe still have.

280 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:31.109
This frequency, let me check.

281 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:35.758
So.

282 "Dev" (353616896)
00:30:35.758 --> 00:30:40.589
Uh, very, uh.

283 "Dev" (353616896)
00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:50.678
Possibly.

284 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:50.678 --> 00:30:55.109
So, many more 23 students and.

285 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:55.109 --> 00:30:59.909
And to 3 students still to get to select the answer.

286 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:03.059
Let's give a few more seconds.

287 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:08.789
When do you want this to this?

288 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:31:13.358 --> 00:31:19.799
Hello sorry um, sorry, let me now.

289 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:28.859
I couldn't because we didn't turn out that was just lagging. And every time I entered me.

290 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.669
Okay, I think, uh, almost there. Okay, so I will we will.

291 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:53.999
So, uh, energy is power.

292 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:58.469
6.55multiplied by time it.

293 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:02.039
Because we use, uh.

294 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:06.779
Standard seconds 5.5hours.

295 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:10.379
Multiply.

296 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:10.379 --> 00:32:13.889
3600, because.

297 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:13.889 --> 00:32:16.919
The unit of time is.

298 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:20.969
10 seconds, 10 seconds the the time that you need.

299 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:20.969 --> 00:32:26.969
So the energy is 1 to 960 jokes.

300 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:26.969 --> 00:32:30.179
Very good. Very good.

301 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:33.209
So, another example is, we can.

302 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:33.209 --> 00:32:40.259
If we have the CO resistance, if we have the resistance in both, and we have the current.

303 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:47.279
So we can see the power is, we can use ice square cause power is as clear. Now.

304 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:57.899
Okay, and it's 81 so if we have, uh, resistance and.

305 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:02.909
And power resistance is and the power is 20 megawatts.

306 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:07.289
So, we, we have resistance, we have power.

307 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:11.099
So, we can find the current.

308 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:11.099 --> 00:33:15.359
Our is ice square up so if we know power.

309 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:19.679
We know resistance we can find the current.

310 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:24.929
It can be fun that it can be fun.

311 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:28.019 --> 00:33:33.179
So well, then to to all, uh, uh.

312 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:42.599
Getting for, uh, doing the quiz and getting good marks correct marks and so the basic circuit on polarities.

313 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:46.409
For businesses for basics um.

314 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:46.409 --> 00:33:49.439
What this is a electron.

315 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:57.419
It's moving from the negative, so we know back to the positive, but for engineers.

316 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:33:57.419 --> 00:34:01.049
More than 100 years ago, when they.

317 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:01.049 --> 00:34:05.129
They decide so, the current I is moving.

318 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:05.129 --> 00:34:10.949
From the positive terminal, so that is for engineers for.

319 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:22.799
It's the electron is moving from negative, but we are engineers so we, we are going to use that. The current is moving from the positive part of the country.

320 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:22.799 --> 00:34:28.949
So, when the common Fernando convention is.

321 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:33.689
When the current enters, uh, enters the system.

322 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:33.689 --> 00:34:37.259
That part we have to become positive.

323 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:37.259 --> 00:34:42.779
The entering of the current the current the point is.

324 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:42.779 --> 00:34:49.109
Positive and then the current that exits exit the resistance, that part is negative.

325 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:58.259
A voltage SaaS energy drives the current electron flow around the.

326 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:34:58.259 --> 00:35:03.869
The value of the resistance are determines how much current can flow.

327 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:09.689
So, the lower the resistance, the higher, the current, if the resistance is lower.

328 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:09.689 --> 00:35:15.359
The carbon is higher, the higher the resistance there lower the current.

329 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:22.889
So, uh, this is the current.

330 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:22.889 --> 00:35:28.349
And is sinusoidal alternating current.

331 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:33.899
So, in the language in in easy terms, uh, this is.

332 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:41.609
The voltage is constant is 5 votes.

333 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:41.609 --> 00:35:44.729
What it is constant over time.

334 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:51.659
Is the voltage is not constant. It's, uh, operating.

335 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:59.249
So that is the main difference, uh, of the DC and.

336 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:35:59.249 --> 00:36:03.299
But of course, there is, uh, average.

337 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:03.299 --> 00:36:08.939
But it's, uh, alternating up down and up down.

338 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:17.549
So, in our hospital, in our household, in in your house, uh, we use, uh, AC.

339 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:28.499
But some like batteries, like, if you have a battery, it uses DC, mobile, phone, battery, or charger users, DC, DC type.

340 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:28.499 --> 00:36:34.889
In our hopes the sockets from the sockets and oh, it's.

341 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:38.909
It's easy. So that's the, the main difference.

342 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:45.899
So, see these tickets so far when the.

343 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:45.899 --> 00:36:55.469
A common type of multi resistance 2nd features serious connection as shown. So when we have a battery or a voltage sauce.

344 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:36:55.469 --> 00:37:03.599
And then we have to resist this connector in this way. There are in series they are in cities. Yeah.

345 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:13.439
So, in order for them to be serious, the 2 elements are 1 and.

346 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:13.439 --> 00:37:16.649
Connected at 1 point.

347 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:16.649 --> 00:37:23.009
So, at 1 common point, the current to each 2nd element is the same.

348 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:23.009 --> 00:37:30.419
So, if they are in series, the total current, total resistance is, are 1 or 2.

349 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:36.149
So, if they are in series, uh, we just add the, the, the individual resistance.

350 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:36.149 --> 00:37:45.629
So do you agree so, this is in series this is serious. Let's say.

351 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:45.629 --> 00:37:49.739
Because they are, uh.

352 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:55.439
Yeah, there there's nothing there's no anyone in between.

353 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:37:55.439 --> 00:38:00.629
Uh, to no elements in between our 2 and 3.

354 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:00.629 --> 00:38:03.659
Serious production, but here.

355 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:07.619
Yeah, I'm not in series. They are not in a series because.

356 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:12.690
In between and there is.

357 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.350
Uh, there is, uh.

358 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:27.660
Junction and another elements, so we cannot say the total resistance is our 1+2+4. We cannot seen it.

359 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.060
This is not in Series series. The condition for series is that.

360 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.650
There is no, uh, there is no, um.

361 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:42.810
Elements or junctions in between 1 and up to.

362 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:51.750
So, if we have this, so this is in series.

363 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:38:51.750 --> 00:39:00.660
This is in serious because there's, there's no, uh, interference or element or junctions.

364 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.470
Uh, this is also in series because.

365 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.460
Let's see from here here.

366 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.240
There is no interruption or.

367 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:20.580
Elements in, in between the resistance in between the resistance. So if you want to add all the total resistance.

368 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.480
Uh, we add all of them.

369 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.320
Individually and to get a total resistance.

370 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.620
This can also be added all of them in the, uh, all the individual resistance can be added.

371 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:42.600
We got the resistance. Okay.

372 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:53.070
So so if we, if we measure.

373 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:57.510
Uh, the resistance using the, we will.

374 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:02.550
We will get if we put the leads here and the other lifts here, we will get.

375 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.760
Total resistance in series.

376 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:15.870
So, we have all of the resistance together to get that +30+100. You will get 140 bucks.

377 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:26.730
Okay, um, they are in serious, I think you agree with me, they are in series .

378 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.110
There are no interruptions this 1 and all of them back to the.

379 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:36.690
From the positive back to the negative. So if we have a point 4 volts.

380 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:45.270
By the way, um, pitch in this book, uh, they use.

381 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:50.460
Is the symbol for, like, uh, what is sauce.

382 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.910
So, what is post now.

383 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.750
What is called slow? I, it goes to.

384 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:04.350
So, we is 8.4votes, but.

385 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:11.880
I is because they are in series, you can add them altogether.

386 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.060
So, I is a.

387 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.110
Is 8.4books and device.

388 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:26.850
All of them, so all of them is 140. so this mean, the same.

389 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:31.440
Close to all of them and they are in series.

390 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.920
In you have the series in this.

391 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:44.520
This example, so if we want to.

392 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:54.000
Measure the voltage can I ask you? Also we want it you want equals.

393 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.250
Ah, very good.

394 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:04.350
Yes, uh, I are 1, but this I is the same.

395 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:09.060
But the, the eye is the same. So I, I call it, I guess.

396 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:14.250
Plus the, uh, so.

397 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:19.530
1 is is 0.06.

398 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.370
And and 1 is 10 booths and similarly.

399 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:27.540
2 is I s.

400 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:32.580
To.

401 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.210
And is the same I. S.

402 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.810
What do you fly.

403 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:47.190
So, you you can measure the voltage.

404 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.670
Um, across this is the 1, the voltage.

405 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:55.680
Cross resistant to and the voltage across resist the 3.

406 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:03.180
And you, if you act, uh, we want last week 2+3 3, you get.

407 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.740
8.4volts, which is.

408 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.090
Same as same as them.

409 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:18.750
Supply both things, so this like, uh, potential divider, it's like dividing the voltage.

410 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.230
Uh, we are 1, we will get.

411 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.440
From 8.4books are 1.

412 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.010
Cross the voltage is 0.6across. Resistor 2 voltage is 1.8.

413 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:41.820
And the most voltage 6 books is across, this is the 3. so this is like a voltage divider, potential divider.

414 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:51.180
So, if we, uh, from this point onwards, if we see a current.

415 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.330
In this direction, so the whole pitch, the resist the polarity.

416 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.690
The voltage cluster is this is.

417 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.950
Entering entering wins positive.

418 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.220
Can negative the carbon is from here.

419 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.520
Entering so positive.

420 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.550
And exiting is negative.

421 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:20.880
The current is in this direction so, and think there is the is positive.

422 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.810
And exiting is negative, so these are the.

423 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.770
Convention that we are going to use from now onwards.

424 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:36.210
So, let's see in here, so.

425 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:42.300
This is a battery of what it sauce and pass positive negative. So, by convention.

426 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.200
The current wave, uh, from the positive side.

427 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.320
Let me know, so, it rich.

428 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.460
Is resistance so we right here positive negative.

429 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:44:53.460 --> 00:45:01.380
And we want, and then then the current will reach here. So we right here positive negatives.

430 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.910
And the current will reach here, so we right here positive.

431 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:15.240
Exiting is negative, so so that is how we determine the priority polarities or.

432 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.460
When the current is entering the resistance, we, we write positive.

433 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.820
You're not positive positive.

434 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:33.210
So, a 2nd is any combination of elements that will result.

435 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.860
In the continuous flow of charge through their configuration.

436 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:43.680
So, what we have is if we have, uh, 3 resistance in series.

437 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.340
The total resistance is.

438 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.090
So, if we look from from the left.

439 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.950
It's 140 s, because it's all in series so we add them.

440 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:02.130
Together as a whole, the resistance is $140.

441 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:08.760
So, if we measure.

442 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.850
Uh, voltage cross.

443 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:20.880
1, week before we do it work with the like this we want to measure across this is to work with the configuration.

444 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.090
And if you want to measure, you.

445 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:31.740
You can measure like this, that you can measure like this. So if you.

446 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:36.540
Reverse the, you can see the rate side here.

447 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:41.010
The black leads, but let's say you want to.

448 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:46.620
Do direct sleeves here and the blacklist here. So you will get -6 because.

449 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:51.660
Uh, it's the priority is.

450 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:04.020
Okay, so that's the voltage.

451 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:10.650
So the voltage can also be if you have 2 batteries.

452 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:16.830
It can be connected in series. 1.5battery 1.5volts.

453 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.890
So, in because they are in series.

454 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.040
Mathematically there are 3 roles.

455 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.260
Yeah, in series, voltage source or both can we added.

456 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.760
So, they, uh, become 3 volts. They become 3 books.

457 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:43.800
So, if we have, uh, 10 goals or 6 and 2 goes in series, so actually, they, uh, just as a whole is 18 votes.

458 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.000
So, but this, you have to be careful a little bit here.

459 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.580
The polarities, so here is the last.

460 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:01.470
So you write here not 29 here negative plus -3.

461 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:04.830
Here plus minus, so last.

462 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.460
For so overall .

463 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.240
-3+4.

464 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.100
.

465 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:22.110
Minus +4 is when you see it, right?

466 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:29.310
So, when you see a -8 books yes. Uh, overall you have to when you draw the battery.

467 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:38.820
So, you draw it as a negative and positive terminal to indicate that it is negative and you can write it moves.

468 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:45.000
Okay, but if you want to, it's not impossible, but if you still want to draw like this.

469 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.110
If you want the job, + and minus, so here you must mention -8 books.

470 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:59.040
But if you already know that is the overall is minus so you can just draw.

471 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.580
So .

472 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.180
It's, it's the .

473 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:14.520
Cause the terminal and you can right beside it. 8 books.

474 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.000
This indicates that it's 8 volts, but.

475 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:27.510
The priority is a negative plus, but if you draw that 3 s plus a minus, you must mention -8 books.

476 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:31.350
But, uh, this is more preferable.

477 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.890
Is this more preferable?

478 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:45.960
This is so.

479 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.693
Any questions so far yes.

480 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:49:49.693 --> 00:50:01.410
Sir, I am trying the meeting because every time I entered it, it wouldn't enter. I just pull out.

481 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:06.295
So, I already I missed the quiz. How can I do it?

482 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:50:10.137 --> 00:50:20.696
It got me up, so when I eventually and so when I eventually entered, I missed a lot of questions and it was even the whole quiz.

483 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:20.696 --> 00:50:21.277
The.

484 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:25.817
Yeah, like I dunno.

485 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:25.817 --> 00:50:31.410
Um, uh, are you.

486 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.470
So, I will take account of your name.

487 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:40.590
So, that you will be, uh, so I know the solution.

488 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:46.293
This 1.

489 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:52.853
No, not.

490 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:50:52.853 --> 00:50:56.314
I just write, uh, the.

491 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:50:56.314 --> 00:51:02.776
Yeah, yeah. Okay. So how can we do.

492 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:08.956 --> 00:51:13.674
Going to be, uh, this lecture will be uploaded in.

493 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:51:13.674 --> 00:51:21.137
Correct it's recording that. I know, but how can I do this? Well, those are the ones.

494 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:21.137 --> 00:51:24.990
That I missed, so, uh, Chris.

495 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:33.776
You can do the next week cause I now know that you have a problem. So I will take your marks for next week.

496 "Rana" (4267811072)
00:51:33.776 --> 00:51:37.194
It's.

497 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:46.950
Okay, so what is now.

498 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:53.190
And KB L which states that the sum of the potential rises and falls.

499 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:58.980
Okay, just around a closed loop within a 0, so let's look.

500 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.280
And this the jobs, what is now.

501 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:13.020
So this is a sucker so if we start from here.

502 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:19.800
Start from here it is key. Okay.

503 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.240
Key so, uh, let's do 1 new.

504 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:32.160
It is a so then we continue.

505 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:37.800
And then we encounter.

506 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:42.180
We encounter 1, so.

507 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.650
The 1 is is .

508 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:52.800
Well, let's say convention, we exit with .

509 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.640
So, we write here -1.

510 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:01.200
And then we continue and we exit.

511 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.450
Be to add the minus, so it's wireless. Uh.

512 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:12.540
And then after that, we cross back close the loop back to the origin.

513 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.920
Equals 00:00:So E.

514 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:21.300
.

515 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:28.050
Because when we exit EA, we encounter plus so it is.

516 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:32.760
Then we go to v1 when we exit, we want.

517 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.960
We encounter a minus a negative like, give me 1.

518 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.410
And then when we exit we to.

519 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:45.690
This site is minus so negative way to and back to the.

520 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.110
Back to the origin, it is equal to 0.

521 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:56.250
So this is, uh, the convention that we use when we use when we want to.

522 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:53:56.250 --> 00:54:01.110
To apply the or a.

523 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.670
So you can, uh.

524 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:16.320
You can use this, or is up to your convenience. You can also use.

525 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.940
This, as long as it is consistent.

526 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.150
So, if you use this.

527 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.390
It's been it's.

528 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:34.950
Negative EA, last week 2 it goes to 0, but it's still the same. If you use.

529 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:41.670
Uh, in this direction, so in this direction, you will encounter negative exit.

530 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:45.300
Negative E. yeah.

531 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.320
When you exit this you encounter, plus we do.

532 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:56.130
Then we go up exit, add 1.

533 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:01.560
And back back to here, and if this.

534 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:09.690
0, so it's still still, uh, produce the same same results. Same results.

535 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:18.300
So, now we but it's, uh, it's.

536 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:23.760
To be safe site we like to start from this 1 and.

537 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:30.690
Go in that way to go in that way. So, in this case, um, if we start here.

538 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:35.100
Stop here we exited with.

539 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:39.570
Then here we exit the 1 with a.

540 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:45.870
Exit fee to miss the reminders it goes to 0 So here we can.

541 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:56.670
We arrange this question so, this, uh, or which is not specified that the break some of the potential rises.

542 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:01.620
And drops around a close path, or is equal to 0.

543 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:12.330
So is equal to 0 So an example.

544 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.900
If we have, uh, this arrangement.

545 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.370
This is 60 votes. This is 40 votes.

546 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:28.140
And this is, we don't notice, uh, we, what we know it is. Uh, we.

547 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.230
So we want to find.

548 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:34.290
We X, so we can use.

549 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:38.850
In kirchhoff's voltage law, the jobs.

550 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:44.070
Well, the snow, for example, in here, we can.

551 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:47.340
All right if we start from here.

552 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.060
Exit is 60+16.

553 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:56.880
And here, my guess.

554 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:08.130
-40, and then the exit is minus the.

555 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:14.070
And then going here, the exits is plus the.

556 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:22.230
Equals to 0, so we can rearrange this question to find.

557 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.680
The X.

558 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:32.130
In here, we can start anywhere. Let's see.

559 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:37.110
We let's say we go this way this time.

560 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:45.240
So, when we go this time, the exit here is for + +14.

561 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.790
Then we reach here are the exit.

562 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:55.380
+6, and then.

563 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:01.440
We go to here, the exit is -2 volts.

564 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.360
And then we go here.

565 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.380
The exits is.

566 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:20.460
Plus the X equal to 0.

567 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:28.860
Um, so this is the, um.

568 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:39.240
The different, um, and here is + and minus. Okay. Plus minus. So you can apply.

569 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:46.260
To get back, uh, you know, unknown voltage you can apply it to get, uh, not voltage.

570 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:52.710
Using L, no, no, it's possible.

571 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:58:52.710 --> 00:59:01.860
Hi, uh, this left, uh, it is, uh, miss typo.

572 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.370
It's a typo actually, there should be a positive here.

573 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:10.350
And negative I will, I will update it.

574 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:16.950
Thank you for the is it positive and positive here and negative.

575 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:26.880
So maybe Mark examples can we can practice.

576 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:32.160
So, we depends on clockwise or anticlockwise we can.

577 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:42.180
Try it, uh, we can try it and let's let's before the break before we reach the 1 hour mark. Uh, let's do the.

578 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:48.330
Let's do the 1 more example of.

579 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:53.700
So so is negative.

580 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
00:59:53.700 --> 01:00:00.840
Positive the, so, let's start, let's start from here and we go.

581 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.590
Um.

582 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.330
And, um.

583 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:14.970
I'm not saying that, um, um.

584 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:23.310
You must exit you must exit use the exit, or you use the positive based on your convenience.

585 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:28.110
If let's say you use this once and you say I.

586 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.800
To avoid confusion I like to use, uh.

587 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:38.010
The, so nevermind be consistent if you use the entry sign.

588 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:45.450
Uh, you use, uh, the entry side if you use the exit signs, you use the exit sites 1st at the end.

589 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:48.870
You will get the same answer based on your convenience.

590 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:53.940
Maybe I like to use the entry.

591 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.240
So, in this example, uh, use the.

592 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:07.650
So, start from here and I enter with last 54 books, but you must use.

593 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:13.050
And then it goes here, I am the at negative 15.

594 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:19.830
That I go here, I am with .

595 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:24.300
Cause I'm using entering the sign minus v2.

596 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.600
And then after that, I.

597 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.550
And count this, I enter with -18.

598 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:40.140
And then I go back to the original the original point, and this is equal to 0.

599 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:44.700
So, based on your convenience, if you want to use the actor use the.

600 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:48.810
Entering sign consistently if you want to use the.

601 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:53.160
Existing signed you use exiting signed for all cases.

602 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.950
And here you can see, 54-5018 is 21.

603 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:05.760
Minus B2, therefore is 21 books.

604 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.380
Veto is 21 votes. Okay.

605 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:20.670
So so the current is moving.

606 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.870
From the point of terminal, so I will I will.

607 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:31.500
Just this 1 by convention, we should use.

608 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.300
Uh, the engineers prevention, so the problem is.

609 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:45.150
Here, that's why the current is sure to be like this because it's from here.

610 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:52.830
It's from the positive. Okay. That's 1. and we do now we have found to be.

611 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:57.600
21 21.

612 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.430
So, what do you think is I, to.

613 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:06.330
So, I do is just the name because.

614 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:13.560
You can call I, or I do, but the current is the same because it's a series.

615 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.390
The current here is the same value, the same value, because it is a serious.

616 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:22.380
So, now, uh, I, too is.

617 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:29.280
Uh, I do is, um.

618 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.730
So we already know 21 votes.

619 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:36.060
And so I do.

620 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:44.970
I too, because here just going out on this is so I agree with you be.

621 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:50.220
Okay.

622 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.480
Voltage over resistance.

623 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.030
So, the voltage here would be 2.

624 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.280
Resistance is here, so I would like you to.

625 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.390
To select the next.

626 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:19.050
Um.

627 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:22.680
So, I would, I would, I would like you to select.

628 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.710
What is the high to.

629 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:32.730
What is the value in MTS and I believe you already told me that I, to.

630 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.750
Is P2 p0 R so.

631 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:44.610
I do is be overall so the voltage.

632 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:52.230
Here over the resistance here, so let's.

633 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.830
Let's go to the next question.

634 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:04:55.830 --> 01:05:15.830
For the next 100 seconds.

635 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:25.920
Okay.

636 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:37.110
Very good. Hold on.

637 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:40.890
Both dates over resistance voltage.

638 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:46.920
The resistance, what is to owner resistance to.

639 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.130
What's this do over resistance to.

640 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:56.400
So, what is 2 is this 1 and resistance too? Is.

641 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:04.770
7 books, so so, 26.

642 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:09.090
26 students in written, still thinking.

643 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:18.810
Still thinking, and now I can see 21 students left 17.

644 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:22.230
And.

645 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:28.320
So, I will you do.

646 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.010
And I will disclose it so soon.

647 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:40.350
I was closed it, so, 21 votes.

648 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:47.610
Uh, divided by 7 votes. So now we know that I do is 3.

649 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:57.300
So, it doesn't because Series 3 everywhere 3:3:Mbps 3 Mbps everywhere.

650 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:02.850
So now we, we, we can find 1.

651 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:10.440
I wanna use it 1, slow voltage. What is.

652 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.520
1 is, you know, voltage is 18.

653 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:20.100
Divided by 3 divided by.

654 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.190
So, you because the 3.

655 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:29.520
Is always the same for the series so now is 6 points.

656 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:38.130
But not least before we go to the break for 5 minutes.

657 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:44.580
What is our 3? So we have found, um.

658 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.470
21 votes we have 4.

659 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:54.660
We have found 1 is 6 months now.

660 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.020
6 hours last, but not this.

661 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:02.940
What is you are going to use again? Right?

662 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:08.160
That's not game up 3 is voltage.

663 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:15.420
Over the same current is the voltage over the same.

664 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:20.340
So, I think I just clicked the next 1.

665 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:27.510
All 3 is the voltage over.

666 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:34.560
Divided by the column, 3 is the voltage divided by the thumb.

667 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.670
It's not.

668 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:48.360
Questions now.

669 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.290
Uh, I will deduct it from.

670 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:08:55.290 --> 01:09:02.280
From the box, I mean, you will this box will not be counted. Okay. That's wrong question.

671 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (2525116672)
01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.770
So, I will right here wrong question.
