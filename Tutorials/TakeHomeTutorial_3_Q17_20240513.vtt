1 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.310
So, let us, let me explain a little bit more about question.

2 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.940
Numbers 17.

3 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
Question number 17. see, if he goes 6.5.

4 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.380
What is the opposite threat? Output? Voltage.

5 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.220
So we have here this 2nd figure 6.5.

6 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.300
You want to fine.

7 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.730
The the open socket voltage, we have.

8 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.950
To find so here to here, we can see.

9 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.760
Here we can see this is open. 2nd.

10 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.320
This is open socket. There is no connection right?

11 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.910
Uh, there is no connection. There's no line.

12 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.870
So, the current view flow here.

13 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.620
So, here it will there is no current.

14 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.150
To this 1, because this is open subject.

15 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.680
It cannot be current. This is open separate. So there is no current to flow here. So all the.

16 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.890
Karen from the battery, or the voltage supply will travel here.

17 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.850
It will alter over here. There is no splitting.

18 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.210
There is no current because.

19 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.260
This is open the socket. Okay. So if this is the case.

20 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.630
Is it is as if the same as.

21 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.530
Withdraw so it's the same as.

22 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.530
So, it's 10 votes and this 6 months.

23 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.610
And these 12 homes is, uh, not relevant because the current.

24 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.700
The, I mean, that's a good.

25 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.740
The current move here there is no current. There's no current here.

26 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:58.800
So because that's open circuit, so this stuff on is not relevant, right? It's not it's not useful.

27 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.330
So we can, uh, draw.

28 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.030
Withdraw, uh, this is correct.

29 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.250
Become just a 2nd.

30 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.870
Okay, so.

31 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.520
This means is still the V out.

32 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.630
Is still the, this means, um.

33 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.560
So this is the same that we want to.

34 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:58.620
Uh, so let me.

35 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:13.890
This bug just deleted.

36 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:31.439
Okay, so it is the same time, uh, 10 votes.

37 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.699
This is for all 76,600. so we L.

38 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.509
Means voltage divider support.

39 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.819
Okay, so I, I will re, draw it.

40 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:58.169
10 volts.

41 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.439
Uh, owns 6 hours.

42 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:10.349
And we want voltage V. L.

43 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.939
Across the 6 forms, so we.

44 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.429
This voltage divider theory. 6.

45 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:27.059
Divide that by daughter 6+4.

46 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:32.999
Multiply by 10 votes.

47 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.999
The answer is 6 books.

48 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:42.419
So the answer sequels, so.

49 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.279
I hope you can see that that 12 is not relevant.

50 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.229
Uh, not not part of the calculation because.

51 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:59.159
Uh, output open socket is open circuit so it's the current.

52 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:07.199
So, when Carlin is 0, the voltage across here is 0, because.

53 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.599
Voltage is I. R and Colin.

54 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.709
0, 0.

55 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:22.199
Multiply by 12, so.

56 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.749
0, so if there is.

57 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.639
Uh, there's no use. There's no use no current. No current flow.

58 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:39.149
So, no current flow because it is part is.

59 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:51.329
Uh, these spikes presented, so no current flow so the 12 forms can be discarded. So it's.

60 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:06:51.329 --> 00:07:02.609
Yes, I like this is not useful so this can be drawn like this, which means.

61 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:13.709
Uh, this and be drawn and this means voltage divider theory. Okay.

62 "Mohd Fareq Abd Malek" (4197920000)
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:18.660
Thank you very much.
